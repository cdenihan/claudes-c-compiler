Add optimization level differentiation (-O0 vs -O2)
====================================================
Priority: MEDIUM

Currently all optimization levels (-O0 through -O3, -Os, -Oz) run the exact
same optimization pipeline (see passes/mod.rs line 248). This means:

- -O0 is no faster to compile than -O2
- Users expecting fast debug builds get full optimization overhead
- -Os/-Oz don't actually optimize for size vs speed

The TODO in the code says "Restore per-level optimization tiers once the compiler
is stable enough." The compiler now builds Linux, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, and
many other projects -- it may be stable enough to start differentiating.

Suggested tiers:
- -O0: Only mem2reg (required for correctness) + constant_fold (for __builtin_constant_p).
  Skip all other passes. Fast compile for debugging.
- -O1: Core passes only (cfg_simplify, copy_prop, dce, constant_fold, simplify)
- -O2: Full pipeline (current behavior)
- -O3: Full pipeline + more aggressive inlining thresholds
- -Os: Full pipeline with size-oriented inlining thresholds
