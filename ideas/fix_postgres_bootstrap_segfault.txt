Fix PostgreSQL bootstrap - NAMEDATALEN not resolved in BKI processing

After fixing the typedef pointer array sizeof bug (which resolved the segfault
caused by attrtypes[40] being only 8 bytes), PostgreSQL initdb now fails with:

  running bootstrap script ... FATAL: invalid input syntax for type smallint: "NAMEDATALEN"
  PANIC: cannot abort transaction 1, it was already committed

The BKI file (postgres.bki) contains literal "NAMEDATALEN" tokens in insert
statements (e.g., for pg_type's typlen column). GCC-compiled postgres handles
this fine, but CCC-compiled postgres fails when passing "NAMEDATALEN" to int2in().

The issue is likely that:
1. The bootstrap code has special handling for these macro constants somewhere
   that CCC miscompiles, OR
2. A struct field access or type mismatch causes the wrong atttypid to be used
   for a column, causing the value to be sent to the wrong input function, OR
3. The TypInfo[] static array (which has NAMEDATALEN as an int16 len field for
   the "name" type) is compiled incorrectly, causing the bootstrap to use wrong
   type info for name-typed columns.

Also observed: "could not write block 0 in file base/1/2@<garbled>" suggesting
a string/path is corrupted, possibly from the same root cause.

Debugging approach:
1. Compare the CCC-compiled TypInfo[] array vs GCC version
2. Check if attrtypes[i]->atttypid is correct for the columns being processed
3. Try mixed compilation: compile bootstrap.o with GCC, rest with CCC
4. Check if there's a sizeof(struct typinfo) mismatch between CCC and GCC
