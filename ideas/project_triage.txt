Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (14):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)
  - jq:            PASS (all backends — fixed exponential const eval hang)
  - mbedtls:       PASS (all 7 tests — fixed peephole bswap store forwarding bug)

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: PARTIALLY FIXED (75/216 tests pass after peephole indirect jump fix)
    Notes: Previous SIGSEGV crash during boolean queries is now FIXED.
           Root cause: peephole store forwarding pass did not classify
           `jmpq *%rax` (computed goto indirect jump) as a jump, so
           computed goto target labels were treated as fallthrough-only.
           This caused incorrect store-to-load forwarding across labels
           that could be entered via indirect jump with different register
           state. Fixed by adding JmpIndirect classification and marking
           all labels as jump targets when indirect jumps are present.
           Remaining failures (~141/216) are due to:
           1. Wrong numeric ln()/sqrt()/log() results (original values
              returned instead of correct computation)
           2. Possible test runner timeout or connection issues for
              later test groups
    Action: Fix numeric computation bugs (ln/sqrt/log functions).

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix postgres wrong numeric ln()/sqrt()/log() computation
  2. Investigate remaining postgres test failures (may be test infrastructure)
  3. Verify liburing is an environment issue
