Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (no action needed):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)

FAILING — needs investigation and fixes:

  lua:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README. Likely a regression.
    Action: Bisect recent commits to find which change broke it.

  mbedtls:
    Status: FAIL (x86 fails, arm fails; times out on some backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README. Possible regression or timeout issue.
    Action: Check for runtime hang (possible LICM or codegen regression). Debug x86 first.

  libpng:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README. Depends on zlib which still passes.
    Action: Investigate build or test failure; may be related to lua/mbedtls regression.

  jq:
    Status: FAIL / TIMEOUT (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README. Times out during build or test.
    Action: Check for infinite loop in generated code or compile-time hang.

  sqlite:
    Status: FAIL / TIMEOUT (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README. Times out during build or test.
    Action: Likely same root cause as jq — possible LICM or optimization regression causing hangs.

  redis:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README.
    Action: Investigate build/link/runtime failure.

  postgres:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously PARTIAL (build succeeded, initdb failed). May have regressed further.
    Action: Low priority — was never fully passing. Fix other regressions first.

  libsodium:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README.
    Action: Investigate; may share root cause with other regressions.

  mquickjs:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README.
    Action: Investigate; may share root cause with other regressions.

  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (x86)
    Notes: Was previously PARTIAL (builds but tests need kernel support). x86 now fails.
    Action: Low priority — check if build itself broke.

  tcc:
    Status: FAIL / TIMEOUT (all backends)
    Notes: Was previously passing per README. Known LICM regression (commit 7bd1987)
           causes TCC binary to hang. verify_tcc.py is blocked by this.
    Action: Fix the LICM regression. This is documented and likely affects other projects too.

  musl:
    Status: PARTIAL (not listed in current failures; build+link works)
    Notes: Hello test passes, some stdio tests fail. malloc works (register asm variable fix).
    Action: Fix stdio printf output issues. Lower priority than full regressions above.

COMMON THEMES:
  - Multiple projects that were previously passing now fail or timeout.
  - The LICM regression (commit 7bd1987) documented in the TCC notes may be a
    root cause for timeouts in jq, sqlite, and tcc.
  - Many failures are likely regressions from recent optimization/codegen changes.
  - Recommended approach: fix the LICM regression first, then re-test all projects
    to see how many are restored.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix LICM regression (unblocks tcc, possibly jq, sqlite)
  2. Fix lua (small project, easy to debug)
  3. Fix libsodium, mquickjs (were fully passing)
  4. Fix mbedtls, libpng, redis (were fully passing)
  5. Fix jq, sqlite timeouts (if not fixed by LICM fix)
  6. Improve postgres, liburing, musl (were only partial)
