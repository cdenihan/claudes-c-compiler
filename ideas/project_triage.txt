Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (14):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)
  - jq:            PASS (all backends — fixed exponential const eval hang)
  - mbedtls:       PASS (all 7 tests — fixed peephole bswap store forwarding bug)

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: PARTIALLY FIXED (43/216 tests pass after sizeof fix)
    Notes: sizeof(string_literal) in static initializers was returning
           pointer size (8) instead of array size. Fixed in sema const_eval.
           Remaining failures (173/216) are due to:
           1. Server SIGSEGV crash during boolean queries (e.g.
              SELECT istrue AND isnul AND istrue FROM booltbl4)
              - cascades to all subsequent tests since server dies
           2. Wrong numeric ln() results (original values returned
              instead of logarithm)
    Action: Debug the SIGSEGV crash (highest priority - cascading failure).
            Try to reproduce with a small standalone C program.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix postgres SIGSEGV during boolean/NULL query execution
  2. Fix postgres wrong numeric ln() computation
  3. Verify liburing is an environment issue
