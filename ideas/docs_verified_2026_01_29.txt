Documentation Verification (2026-01-29, updated; 2026-02-02 full overhaul)
==========================================================================

All README.md files have been audited for correctness against the actual code.

Full Overhaul (2026-02-02):
- README.md: Complete rewrite as proper GitHub project README
  - Fixed GCC version from "6.5"/"6" to "14.2.0"/"14" (matches actual -dumpversion output)
  - Fixed "Optimize (O0-O3)" to include -Os/-Oz
  - Fixed long double claim from "stored as f64 internally" to accurately describe
    x87 inline asm support and ARM/RISC-V soft-float
  - Added _Atomic limitation note
  - Added optimization level uniformity note
  - Updated architecture tree to list ALL backend shared files (liveness.rs, regalloc.rs,
    state.rs, stack_layout.rs, call_abi.rs, cast.rs, f128_softfloat.rs, inline_asm.rs, common.rs)
  - Added dead_statics and resolve_asm to passes listing
  - Added peephole optimization as key design decision
  - Added phi elimination step to pipeline diagram
  - Added Linux kernel verification commands to Testing section
  - Added scripts/ to project organization
  - Reordered project table to show most impressive projects first
  - Removed stale i686 "known limitations" wall-of-text, replaced with focused notes
  - Added -fPIC example to usage
  - Fixed test count to ~900
