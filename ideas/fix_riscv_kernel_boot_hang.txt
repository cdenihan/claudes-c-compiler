Fix RISC-V kernel boot hang on QEMU

The CCC-compiled RISC-V kernel (Linux 6.9, defconfig) successfully builds
and produces a valid Image file, but hangs during early kernel init when
booted on qemu-system-riscv64 -M virt. OpenSBI runs fine and transfers
control to the kernel, but no Linux messages appear.

In contrast, the same kernel compiled with riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc boots
fully to a shell.

This is likely a codegen bug in the RISC-V backend that manifests in
early kernel init code (head.S -> start_kernel path). Possible areas:

1. Inline assembly issues in arch/riscv/kernel/head.S processing
2. Miscompilation of early init C code (setup_arch, etc.)
3. Memory barrier/fence issues affecting early console setup
4. CSR access instruction encoding problems

To debug:
- Build with earlycon=sbi to get SBI console output
- Compare objdump of start_kernel between GCC and CCC builds
- Use QEMU -d in_asm,cpu to trace instruction execution
- Binary search: build most files with GCC, swap CCC objects one at a time
