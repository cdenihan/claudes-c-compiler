Remaining issue from static/inline function fix:

Our compiler sometimes generates BSS globals for local variables declared
inside blocks within switch cases and macro expansions. For example,
'int cond;' inside a { } block might be emitted as a global BSS symbol.
This is likely a parser/codegen scope issue with variable declarations
inside nested blocks.

(static function linkage and inline function emission have been fixed.)
