PIC-relative jump tables for RISC-V (and ARM)

Currently, the RISC-V backend emits absolute .dword entries in jump tables
(.rodata section). This produces R_RISCV_64 relocations pointing to local
labels. This is fine for non-PIC code, but in PIC mode (-fpic), these
absolute references are forbidden by the Linux kernel's EFI stub checker.

GCC solves this by emitting relative jump table entries instead of absolute:
  .word .Ltarget - .Ljumptable_base

The code then loads the base address (via auipc), reads the relative offset
from the table, and adds them together to compute the jump target.

Impact: Fixes EFI stub compilation for files using switch statements
(e.g., drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/gop.c).

Location: src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs (jump table emission)
Also affects: src/backend/common.rs (emit_label_diff for .rodata)
Similar change needed for ARM backend.
