Fix PostgreSQL zic (timezone compiler) segfault

After fixing the BSS struct pointer size bug and -rdynamic flag forwarding,
PostgreSQL initdb completes successfully. However, `make check` fails because
the `zic` binary (timezone info compiler, src/timezone/zic.c) segfaults
during `make install` (temp-install step before running pg_regress).

The zic binary crashes even on `--version`, so this is likely a codegen bug
in how zic.c is compiled, not a data-dependent issue.

To investigate:
1. Try mixed compilation: build zic.o with gcc, rest with ccc
2. If that fixes it, bisect which source file(s) in src/timezone/ are
   miscompiled
3. Create minimal reproducer from the problematic code pattern
4. Fix the underlying codegen bug

This is the last blocker for postgres `make check` (pg_regress regression
tests). Once zic works, the temp-install will succeed and regression tests
can run.
