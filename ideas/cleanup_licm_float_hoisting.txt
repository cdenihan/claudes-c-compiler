Enable LICM float/long-double/i128 load hoisting
=================================================
Priority: LOW

The LICM pass (src/passes/licm.rs line 649) has a TODO saying:
  "Extend to also hoist float, long double, and i128 loads once the
   backend register paths support them."

The backend register paths DO now support float and long double:
- regalloc.rs handles is_float() and is_long_double() types
- All four backends have register allocation

The guard `!ty.is_float() && !ty.is_long_double()` is actively preventing
float/long-double loads from being hoisted out of loops. Removing this
restriction could improve performance for FP-heavy loops.

Risk: Low. The loads being considered are already safe to hoist (non-address-
taken alloca-based loads not modified within the loop). The type restriction
was a conservative choice from when register allocation wasn't available.

Test: Should be verified with FP-heavy benchmarks to ensure no regressions.
