LOW PRIORITY: Remaining refactoring of large functions in IR lowering module

Items 1, 2, and 3 have been completed:
- try_lower_atomic_builtin: converted to table-driven dispatch with classify_fetch_op(),
  classify_op_fetch(), shared helpers (emit_post_rmw_compute, emit_atomic_xchg,
  emit_cmpxchg_with_writeback, load_through_ptr, store_through_ptr). Unified __atomic_*
  and __sync_* variants.
- fill_struct_global_bytes: extracted 15+ helper functions (write_string_to_bytes,
  fill_nested_designator_composite, fill_nested_designator_array, fill_composite_field,
  fill_array_field, fill_fam_field, fill_array_of_composites, fill_array_of_scalars,
  fill_flat_array_of_composites, fill_flat_array_of_scalars, try_fill_string_literal_init,
  get_composite_layout, eval_init_scalar, extract_index_designator). Reduced max nesting
  from 7-8 levels to 3-4.
- lower_global_init: extracted typed_zero_const(), maybe_promote_long_double() helpers
  to eliminate repeated long-double promotion patterns.

Remaining (lower priority, less severe):

4. get_expr_type (types.rs, ~250 lines)
   - Type inference for expressions, split across two match blocks with fallthrough
   - The two match blocks should be unified into one clean dispatch

5. lower_function (lowering.rs, ~286 lines)
   - Could be split into: lower_function_params, lower_function_body, emit_implicit_return
