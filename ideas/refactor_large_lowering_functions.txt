LOW PRIORITY: Remaining refactoring of large functions in IR lowering module

Items 1, 2, 3, 4b, 4c have been completed:
- try_lower_atomic_builtin: table-driven dispatch (classify_fetch_op, classify_op_fetch)
- fill_struct_global_bytes: 15+ extracted helpers, reduced nesting from 7-8 to 3-4 levels
- lower_global_init: typed_zero_const(), maybe_promote_long_double() helpers
- Global init subsystem extracted to global_init.rs (1950+ lines, 44 functions)
- Shared helpers extracted: resolve_typedef_derived(), register_function_meta(),
  intern_string_literal(), push_zero_bytes() - eliminating 18+ duplication sites

Remaining (lower priority, less severe):

4. get_expr_type (types.rs, ~250 lines)
   - Type inference for expressions, split across two match blocks with fallthrough
   - The two match blocks should be unified into one clean dispatch

5. lower_function (lowering.rs, ~286 lines)
   - Could be split into: lower_function_params, lower_function_body, emit_implicit_return
