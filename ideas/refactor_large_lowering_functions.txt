MEDIUM PRIORITY: Further refactoring of large functions in IR lowering module

The initial refactoring pass (SwitchFrame/FunctionMeta, bitfield helpers, intrinsic
consolidation, member access unification) reduced 162 lines. These functions remain:

1. try_lower_atomic_builtin (expr.rs, ~445 lines)
   - Chain of ~25 if-name-matches blocks for __atomic_* and __sync_* builtins
   - Each block follows the same pattern: check name, parse args, emit 1-2 IR instructions
   - Should be refactored to use a table-driven approach: map function name -> handler
   - The __sync_* variants are identical to __atomic_* but with hardcoded SeqCst ordering

2. fill_struct_global_bytes (lowering.rs, ~333 lines)
   - Handles global struct initialization with designators, nested structs, arrays
   - Deeply nested match arms that are hard to follow
   - Should be broken into: fill_scalar, fill_array_of_structs, fill_designated_field,
     fill_flat_array, fill_string_literal sub-functions

3. lower_global_init (lowering.rs, ~292 lines)
   - Handles all global initializer forms (scalar, array, string, compound, struct)
   - The Initializer::List arm (lines 939-1123) is a single match arm with 184 lines
   - Should be split into lower_array_global_init, lower_struct_global_init, etc.

4. get_expr_type (types.rs, ~250 lines)
   - Type inference for expressions, split across two match blocks with fallthrough
   - The two match blocks should be unified into one clean dispatch

5. lower_function (lowering.rs, ~286 lines)
   - Could be split into: lower_function_params, lower_function_body, emit_implicit_return
