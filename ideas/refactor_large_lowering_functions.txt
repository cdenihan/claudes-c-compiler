LOW PRIORITY: Remaining lowering function refactoring opportunities

Completed:
- lower_local_decl (stmt.rs): decomposed from 552 lines to ~130 lines via stmt_init.rs helpers
- lower_stmt Return arm: decomposed from 194 lines to 4 lines via stmt_return.rs
- Duplicated scope-tracking pattern: extracted to shadow_local_for_scope/shadow_static_for_scope
- Duplicated function meta registration: extracted to register_block_func_meta
- Removed unnecessary cond_label_ref clone in for-loop lowering

Remaining (diminishing returns):
- lower_function (lowering.rs, ~497 lines): has clear phase comments, could split param
  handling into sub-methods but structure is already readable
- emit_struct_init (stmt.rs, ~438 lines): complex but inherently so due to C designated
  initializer spec. Could extract CType::Array arms but adds indirection without clarity gain
