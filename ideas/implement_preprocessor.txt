Remaining preprocessor work:
- Complete variadic macro support (named variadic params, ##__VA_ARGS__ GNU extension)
- #line directive support for source mapping
- _Pragma operator
- Handle __has_attribute properly (return correct values for common attributes)
  Currently we define it as a macro returning 0, but GCC supports many attributes
  and glibc headers check for specific ones.
