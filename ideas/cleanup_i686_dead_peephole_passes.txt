Clean up dead/disabled peephole passes in i686 backend
======================================================
Priority: LOW

The i686 peephole optimizer (src/backend/i686/codegen/peephole.rs) has three
disabled passes marked with #[allow(dead_code)]:

1. Global store forwarding (line ~851): Disabled due to 21 FP computation
   regressions. FP load/store forwarding patterns need investigation.

2. Callee-save push/pop elimination (line ~1475): Disabled due to stack
   misalignment causing 97+ segfault regressions. Breaks the
   leal -N(%ebp),%esp epilogue pattern.

3. Function-level callee-save removal (line ~1542): Disabled because it
   removes push/pops that the epilogue pattern depends on.

These should either be:
a) Fixed and re-enabled (preferred), or
b) Removed entirely if superseded by other approaches

The x86-64 peephole has working versions of all these passes, so the i686
versions may be able to borrow from the x86-64 implementation with
appropriate 32-bit adjustments.
