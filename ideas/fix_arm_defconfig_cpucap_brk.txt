Fix ARM64 defconfig kernel BRK crash in cpucap_is_possible

After fixing the GOT relocation issue, the ARM64 defconfig kernel boots much
further but crashes with a BRK #0 in cpucap_is_possible().

Root cause: cpucap_is_possible() uses compiletime_assert(__builtin_constant_p(cap))
which expects the cap argument to always be a compile-time constant. When
__builtin_constant_p() doesn't properly evaluate to 1 after inlining, the
compiletime_assert generates a brk #0 at runtime.

Call trace:
  cpucap_is_possible <- ___slab_alloc <- __slab_alloc <- kmem_cache_alloc_node
  <- init_kmem_cache_nodes <- kmem_cache_open <- __kmem_cache_create
  <- create_boot_cache <- kmem_cache_init <- mm_core_init <- start_kernel

The issue is that the compiler doesn't properly propagate constant values
through the __always_inline call chain, so __builtin_constant_p(cap)
evaluates to 0 instead of 1, leaving the brk #0 in the generated code.

Possible fixes:
1. Improve __builtin_constant_p handling after inlining: after an
   __always_inline function is inlined and its argument becomes a constant,
   re-evaluate __builtin_constant_p to 1.
2. Improve the IsConstant IR instruction resolution in constant_fold pass.
3. Handle __attribute__((error("msg"))) properly: if the function is never
   called after optimization, eliminate it entirely. If it IS called,
   emit a compile-time error instead of a brk #0.

This only affects the defconfig kernel, not tinyconfig (which boots fine).
