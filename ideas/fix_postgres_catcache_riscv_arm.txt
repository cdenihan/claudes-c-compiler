Fix postgres catcache lookup failure on RISC-V and ARM
======================================================

Status: BOTH FIXED.

ARM fix: The ARM backend was missing sign extension (sxtw) after 32-bit Shl
and AShr operations. When the narrowing pass narrowed an I64 shift to I32,
the ARM codegen emitted `lsl w0, w1, w2` which zero-extends to x0. Subsequent
64-bit operations (like AShr by 63 from div_by_const expansion) saw the wrong
sign, causing negative values to be treated as large positive numbers. This
caused numeric ln() to hang (infinite loop in sqrt reduction) which made
make check time out.

RISC-V fix: The RISC-V backend used B-type branch instructions (beq/bgeu)
with only +-4KB range for switch case dispatch and jump table range checks.
In large PostgreSQL functions (e.g. ExecInterpExpr with hundreds of switch
cases), the branch targets exceeded 4KB, causing silent overflow and incorrect
execution. This manifested as catcache lookup failures during initdb because
the B-tree index scan was silently broken. Fixed by replacing beq with
bne+jump and bgeu with bltu+jump patterns (+-2GB range via auipc+jalr).
