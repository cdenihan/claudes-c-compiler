Register allocator -- DONE (all 3 backends)

Linear scan register allocator with callee-saved registers is implemented for:
- x86-64: rbx, r12-r15 (5 registers)
- AArch64: x20-x28 (9 registers) -- with register-direct ALU via 3-operand ISA
- RISC-V: s1, s7-s11 (6 registers)

Liveness analysis uses backward dataflow iteration and supports loops.
ARM integration skips variadic functions to avoid callee-save/VA-save area conflicts.

Remaining improvements:
1. Eliminate write-through: currently every store goes to both stack AND register.
   Skip the stack store when the value is register-allocated and has no other
   readers (requires use-def chains or a smarter analysis).
2. Register-to-register operations: instead of rax/rcx accumulator model,
   emit operations directly on callee-saved registers (e.g., addq %r12, %rbx
   instead of movq %r12, %rax / addq %rbx, %rcx / ... / movq %rax, %r15).
3. Spill/reload insertion: currently values that don't fit spill to the existing
   stack slot. A proper spill/reload would move values between registers and
   stack at optimal points.
4. Call-clobber handling: currently functions with inline asm or atomics bail out.
   Should instead insert saves around clobbering instructions.
5. ARM variadic support: currently skipped; need to handle callee-save area
   placement relative to VA register save areas.
