Fix TLS global address folding optimization

The GlobalAddr folding optimization (build_global_addr_map) was including TLS
symbols in the map, allowing them to be folded into direct symbol(%rip) accesses
instead of going through the required TLS access patterns (%fs:/@TPOFF on x86-64,
%gs:/@NTPOFF on i686, etc.).

This caused writes to initialized thread-local variables to write to the .tdata
template section (read-only at runtime) instead of the per-thread TLS storage,
resulting in segfaults (e.g., Janet bootstrap crash in janet_collect).

Fix: Exclude TLS symbols from build_global_addr_map so they are never candidates
for the RIP-relative fold optimization.

Status: in_progress
