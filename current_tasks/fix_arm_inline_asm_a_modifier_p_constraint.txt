Task: Fix ARM inline asm '%a' modifier and 'p' constraint for prefetch instructions
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: AArch64 kernel prefetch functions use:
  asm volatile("prfm pldl1keep, %a0\n" : : "p" (ptr));
  asm volatile("prfm pstl1keep, %a0\n" : : "p" (ptr));

The '%a' modifier on AArch64 means "emit as memory address [reg]".
The 'p' constraint means "address operand" (pointer).

Our compiler doesn't recognize '%a' as a valid ARM inline asm modifier,
so %a0 is emitted verbatim instead of being substituted with [xN].
This causes assembly failures in mm/page_alloc.c and any other file
that uses prefetch().

Fix: Add 'a' to the list of recognized ARM modifiers and handle it
in format_reg_static to wrap the register in square brackets [reg].
The 'p' constraint already falls through to GpReg which is correct.
