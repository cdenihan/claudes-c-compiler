Fix all clippy warnings across the codebase to achieve a clean build.
This includes:
- Dead code warnings (unused functions, structs, enums, variants, fields)
- Redundant field names in struct initialization
- Unnecessary casts
- Code style issues (collapsed if, map_or simplification, etc.)
- Unreachable patterns
- Other misc clippy lints
