Fix xmmintrin.h: add missing #include <emmintrin.h> for GCC compatibility

GCC's xmmintrin.h includes emmintrin.h at the end of the file, so code that
includes only <xmmintrin.h> still gets access to __m128i and SSE2 intrinsics.
Our xmmintrin.h is missing this include, causing pixman (and likely other
projects) to fail to compile when they include xmmintrin.h and use __m128i.

Fix: Add #include <emmintrin.h> at the end of xmmintrin.h, matching GCC's
behavior.
