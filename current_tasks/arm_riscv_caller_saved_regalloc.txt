Task: Add caller-saved register allocation to ARM and RISC-V backends
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Goal: Bring ARM and RISC-V backends to parity with x86 by enabling
Phase 2 (caller-saved) register allocation. Currently both backends
pass Vec::new() as the caller-saved pool, disabling this optimization.

Changes:
- ARM: Define caller-saved pool (subset of x9-x15), extend register
  name mappings, add safety filtering, pass pool to regalloc
- RISC-V: Define caller-saved pool (subset of t2-t6), extend register
  name mappings, add safety filtering, pass pool to regalloc
- Both: Exclude registers used as scratch/address by the codegen
