Fix RISC-V assembler .subsection directive

The RISC-V assembler currently ignores .subsection N directives (treats them
as no-ops). This causes the kernel ALTERNATIVE macro to place alternative code
in wrong sections (e.g., .rodata instead of .text), producing cross-section
R_RISCV_JAL relocations that overflow during vmlinux linking.

Fix: Implement proper .subsection support in the RISC-V assembler by calling
set_subsection() and merge_subsections() (already implemented in elf.rs),
matching what the ARM assembler already does.
