Fix asm goto label elimination causing undefined .L label references

Problem: When arch_static_branch (a static inline function with asm goto)
is emitted as a standalone function, the inline asm has "i" (immediate-only)
constraints that can't be satisfied (the values are function parameters, not
constants). The cfg_simplify pass detects this via asm_goto_will_be_skipped()
and removes the goto label blocks as unreachable. However, the codegen still
emits the asm template (with $0 placeholders for immediates), which references
the now-eliminated goto labels via %l[l_yes]. This causes linker errors:
"undefined reference to .L34".

Fix: Add a matching skip check in the inline asm codegen. When an asm goto
has unsatisfiable immediate-only constraints and uses .pushsection, skip the
entire asm emission in codegen (don't emit the template or load/store operands).
This makes codegen consistent with cfg_simplify's reachability analysis.
