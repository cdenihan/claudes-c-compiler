Fix typedef pointer array global initialization

When a global array uses a typedef'd pointer type (e.g. `typedef const struct Foo *FooPtr;
static const FooPtr arr[] = { NULL, &foo1, &foo2 };`), the address-of initializers
are silently dropped, resulting in all-NULL arrays. This directly causes the
PostgreSQL initdb "unrecognized lock method: 1" crash because the LockMethods[]
array (typed via LockMethod typedef) is not initialized.

The bug is in the global init lowering path where typedef pointer types are not
properly recognized as needing relocation entries for address-of expressions.
