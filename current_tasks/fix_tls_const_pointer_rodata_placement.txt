Task: Fix TLS const pointer variable placed in read-only section
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
Thread-local variables declared as `static __thread const char *ptr;` are being
placed in a read-only TLS section (.rodata or .tbss with wrong permissions).
The `const` qualifier applies to the pointed-to type (char), not to the pointer
itself, so the pointer should be writable.

This causes a segfault when the pointer is assigned:
  static __thread const char *my_global;
  my_global = "hello";  // SIGSEGV - writing to read-only memory

Affects: stb_image project (crashes in stbi__check_png_header), and likely
any project using thread-local pointers to const data.

Fix: The section/constness determination for global/static variables needs to
check whether the top-level type is const-qualified, not whether any nested
type qualifier is const. For `const char *`, the top-level type is `pointer`
which is not const-qualified.
