Task: Fix complex number scalar conversion issues

Fixes three key bugs in complex number type handling:

1. crealf/creal/creall with non-complex arguments: When passing a scalar (int, char, etc.)
   to crealf/creal/creall, the scalar must be cast to the appropriate float type first.
   Previously returned the raw integer value without conversion.

2. Scalar-to-complex return conversion: When returning a non-complex expression from a
   function with complex return type (both sret and non-sret paths), use scalar_to_complex
   which works from the IR type rather than the CType (which can be inaccurate for
   function call expressions where expr_ctype falls back to Int).

3. Complex array dereference (*arr): Dereferencing an array of complex elements should
   return the address of the first element (since complex values are aggregates),
   not load a scalar value. Both lower_deref and expr_ctype needed updates to handle
   Array types in addition to Pointer types.

Status: In progress
