Fix O(n^2) performance in IR lowering due to scope clone/restore pattern

The lowering phase clones the entire locals HashMap, enum_constants HashMap,
static_local_names HashMap, and const_local_values HashMap on every compound
statement entry (lower_compound_stmt) and on every function entry (lower_function).

For mbedtls with ~250 enum constants and many inline functions from headers,
this causes 2+ second compilation times for small files (debug.c: 261 lines).

Fix approach:
1. Replace clone/restore with scope-stack pattern for locals and enum_constants:
   - Track which keys were added in the current scope
   - On scope exit, remove only those keys (O(scope_additions) instead of O(total_map_size))
2. Skip lowering unused static inline functions (dead code from headers)
3. Wrap StructType in Arc inside CType to avoid deep-cloning struct field lists
   (was 54% of time spent in malloc/free from CType cloning per perf profile)

Results:
- mbedtls ssl_tls.c: lowering phase 5.5s -> 84ms (66x speedup)
- mbedtls debug.c: lowering phase 2.8s -> 10ms (280x speedup)

Status: Complete
