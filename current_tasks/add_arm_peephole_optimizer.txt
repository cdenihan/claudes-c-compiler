Task: Add AArch64 (ARM) peephole optimizer

Adding a post-codegen peephole optimization pass for the AArch64 backend,
similar to what already exists for x86 and RISC-V.

Key optimizations:
1. Adjacent store/load elimination (str/ldr at same sp offset)
2. Redundant branch elimination (b to next label)
3. Self-move elimination (mov xN, xN)
4. Move chain optimization (mov A, B; mov C, A -> mov C, B)
5. Dead store elimination (overwritten before read)
6. Redundant sxtw elimination (sxtw x0, w0 after value already sign-extended)

Status: in progress
