Fix zstd compilation with MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin on x86:
- Define __ASSEMBLER__ when preprocessing .S files with builtin assembler
- Add .pushsection/.popsection support to x86/i686 assembler
- Add BMI2 instruction support (shrxq/shlxq/sarxq + suffix-less forms)
- Add bitwise OR/AND and parenthesized expression support in .long/.quad
- Add numeric label resolution in data directives (.long/.quad)
