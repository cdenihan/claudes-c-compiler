Fix anonymous struct key collision between sema and lowerer phases.

When many anonymous typedef structs exist (e.g., TCC's elf.h), the lowerer's
anonymous struct counter (in TypeContext) starts at 0 and overwrites struct
layouts that sema stored at the same __anon_struct_N keys. This causes field
accesses to use the wrong struct layout, generating stores to the wrong offset
with the wrong type.

Fix: synchronize TypeContext's anon_ctype_counter with sema's counter in
into_result(), so the lowerer starts past all IDs used by sema.
