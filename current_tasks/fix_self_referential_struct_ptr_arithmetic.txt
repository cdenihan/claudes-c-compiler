Fix self-referential struct pointer arithmetic bug

When a struct S has a member `struct S *ptr`, pointer arithmetic on
`c->ptr + n` incorrectly uses stride 1 instead of sizeof(struct S).

Root cause: The pointee type of a self-referential struct pointer is
likely being resolved as an incomplete/unsized type (1 byte) instead
of the fully resolved struct type.

This bug causes redis-server to segfault on startup.
