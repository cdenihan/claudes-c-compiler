Add source locations (file:line) to preprocessor #error, #warning, and #include-not-found diagnostics.

Currently preprocessor errors/warnings are stored as plain Vec<String> without any
source location information. When forwarded to the DiagnosticEngine, they use the
_no_span variants and render without file:line:col prefixes.

GCC outputs these with full file:line:col locations, e.g.:
  test.c:5:2: error: #error "bad config"
  test.c:3:10: fatal error: nonexistent.h: No such file or directory

Plan:
1. Add a PreprocessorDiagnostic struct with file, line, and message fields
2. Change preprocessor errors/warnings from Vec<String> to Vec<PreprocessorDiagnostic>
3. Populate file+line at the #error, #warning, and #include error sites
4. Update driver to render these with GCC-compatible file:line: prefix formatting
