Fix x86 assembler: .word directive silently ignored

The x86 assembler parser does not handle .word or .hword directives.
On x86 GAS, .word is a synonym for .short (2 bytes), and .hword is also
a 2-byte data directive. Both fall through to the catch-all _ => branch
and are silently dropped as AsmItem::Empty.

This causes the asm-immediate-string-literal-x86 unit test to SIGSEGV
because the .word 99 in the .pushsection block is skipped, causing
the struct layout to be wrong.

Fix: add ".word" | ".hword" as aliases alongside ".short" | ".value" | ".2byte".
