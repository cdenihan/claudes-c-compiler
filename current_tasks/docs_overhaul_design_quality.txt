Docs Overhaul: Design-Doc Quality READMEs
==========================================

Status: in_progress

Goal: Comprehensive documentation overhaul
- Audit all READMEs against actual code for accuracy
- Remove references to external test pipelines/verify scripts
- Remove project compilation lists from README
- Ensure architecture diagrams explain how things fit together
- Write design-doc quality explanations for major subsystems
- Make docs complete enough that code can be skipped for understanding
