Fix preprocessor token spacing after macro expansion

Problem: When a macro expands to a token like `-`, and the next token is `--`,
the preprocessor produces `---` instead of `- --`. This is because the preprocessor
does not insert whitespace between macro-expanded tokens and adjacent tokens that
could form longer tokens when concatenated.

Example:
  #define M(x) x
  c = a M(-)-- b;  // should expand to: c = a - -- b;
                    // actually expands to: c = a --- b;

This causes compiler_suite_0122_0011 to fail (and may affect other tests).

The fix needs to be in the preprocessor's token output when expanding macros,
ensuring a space is inserted between tokens that could merge.
