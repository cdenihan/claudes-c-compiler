Task: Fix i686 integer literal type determination and limits macros
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Description:
The lexer has no target awareness and uses hardcoded 64-bit thresholds for
integer literal type determination. On i686 (ILP32), long is 32-bit, so:

1. A literal like 4294967290l should become long long (not long) because
   the value doesn't fit in a 32-bit signed long. The lexer currently
   always treats 'l' suffix as LongLiteral regardless of value.

2. The builtin LONG_MAX/ULONG_MAX macros in builtin_macros.rs use 64-bit
   values, which is wrong for i686.

3. The integer constant type promotion chain (C11 6.4.4.1) needs to be
   target-aware for the `l` suffix case.

Fix approach:
- Make the lexer/sema/lowering aware of target integer sizes when determining
  literal types, OR add a fixup pass in sema/lowering that promotes
  LongLiteral values that don't fit in the target's long to LongLong.
- Fix LONG_MAX/ULONG_MAX for i686.
