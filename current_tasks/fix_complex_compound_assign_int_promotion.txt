Fix complex compound assignment with integer promotion

Bug: complex_float_var += int_value produces wrong results because:
1. common_complex_type() incorrectly promotes integers to ComplexDouble
2. lower_compound_assign doesn't handle type mismatch between LHS and result

Fix:
1. Integer types now adopt the other operand's complex type per C11 6.3.1.8
2. Compound assign now converts LHS to result type, performs op, then converts back

Status: In progress
