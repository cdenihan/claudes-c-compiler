Fix SSE register-to-register encoding bug in x86 builtin assembler.

The encode_sse_rr_rm function's register-to-register case has a broken
prefix detection heuristic: the condition `b >= 0x38` treats the mandatory
0x66 prefix as an opcode byte and skips it, causing SSE2 instructions
like movdqa/movdqu/movupd to be encoded as MMX instructions when both
operands are XMM registers.

For example, `movdqa %xmm0, %xmm1` is encoded as `0F 6F C8` (MMX movq)
instead of `66 0F 6F C8` (SSE2 movdqa).

This affects all SSE instructions using the 0x66 prefix in reg-reg mode.
