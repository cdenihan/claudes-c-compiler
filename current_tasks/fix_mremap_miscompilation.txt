Task: Fix miscompilation of drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c causing kernel boot failure
(Originally was mremap.c but that was fixed by another contributor.)

Problem: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing kernel boot failure.
This file handles ACPI memory hotplug device support.

Status: investigating root cause by comparing ccc output with GCC output
