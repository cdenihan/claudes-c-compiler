Task: Fix miscompilation of mm/mremap.c causing kernel boot failure

Problem: mm/mremap.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing the kernel to fail to boot.
This file handles memory remapping (mremap syscall). A miscompilation here breaks
critical memory management functionality.

Status: investigating root cause by comparing ccc output with GCC output
