Fix: enum-constant array sizes in struct layout computation

Bug: When a struct field is another struct containing an array sized by an enum
constant (e.g., `void *arr[ENUM_COUNT]`), the outer struct's sizeof is wrong.
The enum constants were collected in Pass 2 but struct layouts were computed in
Pass 0, so enum-constant array sizes resolved to None (incomplete = 8 bytes).

Fix: Move collect_all_enum_constants() to run before Pass 0 struct registration.

This caused a Lua segfault regression (sizeof(LG) was 1424 instead of 1624,
causing heap corruption in lua_newstate).
