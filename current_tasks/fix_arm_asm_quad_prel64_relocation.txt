Fix ARM assembler: .quad symbol+offset-. emits wrong R_AARCH64_PREL32 instead of R_AARCH64_PREL64

Three interconnected bugs in the AArch64 assembler:

1. Parser (parser.rs try_parse_symbol_diff): does not decompose sym_a "symbol+offset" into
   separate symbol and addend. E.g., "cgroup_bpf_enabled_key+48" was treated as a single
   symbol name instead of symbol "cgroup_bpf_enabled_key" with addend 48.

2. ELF writer (elf_writer.rs resolve_sym_diffs): always emits R_AARCH64_PREL32 (32-bit
   PC-relative) regardless of data size. For .quad (8 bytes), it should emit R_AARCH64_PREL64.

3. Encoder (encoder.rs RelocType): missing Prel64 variant (ELF type 260) needed for
   64-bit PC-relative relocations.

This breaks the kernel's __jump_table section which uses:
    .quad cgroup_bpf_enabled_key+48 - .
to encode static key references. The wrong relocation causes link failure:
    undefined reference to `cgroup_bpf_enabled_key+48'
    relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_PREL32
