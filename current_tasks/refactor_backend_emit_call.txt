Task: Refactor backend emit_call and emit_store_params into shared default implementations

Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
- emit_call is 170-460 lines in each of the 3 backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
- The algorithmic structure is identical across all three: classify args, emit stack args,
  load register args, emit call instruction, clean up stack, store return value
- Only the instruction mnemonics and register names differ
- emit_store_params has the same pattern of duplicated iteration logic

Plan:
1. Add new small trait methods as arch-specific hooks (e.g. emit_call_instruction,
   emit_call_store_return, emit_call_push_stack_arg, etc.)
2. Move the shared algorithmic skeleton into default implementations in traits.rs
3. Reduce each backend's emit_call from 200-450 lines to ~50-80 lines of arch hooks
4. Same pattern for emit_store_params

Expected savings: ~800-1000 lines of duplicated code eliminated
