Fix packed bitfield load/store for fields that span storage unit boundaries.

Problem:
When #pragma pack(1) or __attribute__((packed)) is used, bitfield layout allows fields
to cross byte boundaries. For example, a struct with:
  unsigned char mb:8;
  unsigned char m0:4;
  unsigned char m1:8;  // starts at bit 12, spans bytes 1-2
  unsigned char m2:4;

Field m1 has storage_offset=1, bit_offset=4, bit_width=8, storage_type=I8.
But bit_offset + bit_width = 12 > 8 (storage type bits), so the field
spans beyond the single byte that store_bitfield/extract_bitfield loads.

Fix:
1. In the layout computation (types.rs), when a packed bitfield's bit_offset + bit_width
   exceeds the storage type's bit width, widen the storage type to cover all needed bits.
2. Update store_bitfield and extract_bitfield to handle the widened storage type correctly.

This fixes ~17 pragma-pack test failures (68% fail rate → should become near 0%).
