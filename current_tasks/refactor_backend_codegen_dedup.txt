Task: Refactor backend codegen - extract shared instruction dispatch logic

The three backend codegen files (x86/codegen.rs, arm/codegen.rs, riscv/codegen.rs)
have massive structural duplication. generate_instruction(), generate_function(),
calculate_stack_space(), and generate_terminator() are structurally identical
across all three backends, differing only in register names, mnemonics, and ABI details.

This refactoring will:
1. Extract a shared codegen framework that handles the instruction dispatch loop
2. Define a trait/interface for arch-specific operations (emit_binop, emit_store, etc.)
3. Implement the trait for each architecture
4. Reduce ~1800 lines of codegen to ~600 lines shared + ~200 lines per backend

This eliminates the cross-backend inconsistency bugs and makes adding new IR
instructions a one-place change instead of three.

Status: In progress
