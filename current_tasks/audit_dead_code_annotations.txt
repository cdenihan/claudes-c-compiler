Task: Audit and clean up #[allow(dead_code)] annotations across the codebase

- Remove truly dead code (unused functions/constants with no callers under any feature flag)
- Add explanatory comments to justified dead_code annotations (feature-gated code,
  disabled-but-planned optimizations, ELF standard constants, public API surface)
- Verify no regressions with build + test suite
