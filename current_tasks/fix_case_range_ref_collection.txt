Fix: CaseRange statements missing from reference collection

Bug: The dead static function elimination pass (ref_collection.rs) did not walk
into Stmt::CaseRange nodes. This caused static inline functions referenced only
from GNU range case expressions (case LOW ... HIGH:) to have their bodies
skipped during lowering, resulting in undefined symbol errors at link time.

Impact: Kernel file fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c fails to link because arch_elf_pt_proc
(a static inline returning 0) is called inside a range case but its body is never
emitted.

Fix: Add CaseRange variant handling in collect_refs_from_stmt alongside the
existing Case handling.
