Cleaning up linker dispatch mechanisms to be more parallel between x86-64 and i686.

Currently:
- i686: dispatched in mod.rs via MY_LD=builtin match arm, with CRT/lib discovery
  self-contained inside i686/linker/elf.rs
- x86-64: dispatched in common.rs via ELF machine number check, with CRT/lib
  discovery done in common.rs wrapper (link_builtin_x86)

Goal: Make both paths use the same pattern:
- Both route through mod.rs for MY_LD=builtin dispatch
- Both use common.rs DirectLdArchConfig for CRT/lib discovery
- Both linkers accept pre-resolved CRT objects and lib paths as parameters
