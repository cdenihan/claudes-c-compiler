Task: Increase multi-line macro accumulation limit from 20 to 200 lines

Problem:
The preprocessor had a hard limit of 20 lines for multi-line macro argument
accumulation. When a function-like macro invocation spans more than 20 lines
(with unbalanced parentheses), the accumulator would flush prematurely, sending
the incomplete macro text through regular expansion with unbalanced parens.

This caused redis server.c to fail: FMTARGS() calls with 25+ format-value pairs
spanning 30+ lines would get truncated, resulting in COMPACT_FMT_41 (wrong arg
count) instead of COMPACT_FMT_50 (correct count).

Fix:
Increased the multi-line accumulation limit from 20 to 200 lines. This is safe
because the accumulation only happens when parens are genuinely unbalanced (a
function-like macro argument list that hasn't been closed yet).

Real-world impact: Fixes redis server.c FMTARGS preprocessing, a prerequisite
for building redis (still blocked by compilation performance issues in other files).

Status: Completed
