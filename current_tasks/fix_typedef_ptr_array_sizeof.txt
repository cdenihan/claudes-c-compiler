Fix sizeof and BSS allocation for arrays of typedef'd pointer types

Bug: typedef int *IntPtr; IntPtr arr[10]; - sizeof(arr) returns 8 instead of 80.
The array dimension is lost when the pointer comes from a typedef rather than
a derived declarator. This causes BSS globals like Form_pg_attribute attrtypes[40]
in PostgreSQL to be allocated only 8 bytes instead of 320, causing memory corruption.

Fix: In compute_decl_info (types.rs), when pointer_from_type_spec is true, don't
use synthetic position Some(0) for pointer in derived list. Let it fall through
to collect_derived_array_dims which correctly collects all array dims.
