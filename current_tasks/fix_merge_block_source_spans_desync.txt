Fix merge_single_pred_blocks source_spans desync causing DCE panic

The merge_single_pred_blocks pass in cfg_simplify.rs can create blocks where
source_spans.len() != instructions.len() when merging a predecessor that has
spans with a successor that doesn't (or vice versa). This causes panics in
multiple subsequent passes:

1. DCE panics at dce.rs:126 with "index out of bounds" when swapping spans
2. LICM panics at licm.rs:543 when indexing old_spans
3. Inline pass has similar OOB risk at inline.rs:1238

Root cause: merge_single_pred_blocks appends instructions from the successor
but only conditionally appends spans (based on whether converted_spans is
non-empty), without checking if the predecessor already has spans.

Fix:
1. Fix merge_single_pred_blocks to maintain the source_spans invariant:
   - If either block has spans, pad the other with dummy spans to keep parallel
2. Add defensive bounds checking in DCE and inline passes
3. Add regression test

Status: in_progress
