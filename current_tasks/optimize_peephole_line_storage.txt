Task: Optimize peephole optimizer line storage to reduce heap allocations

Problem:
The x86 peephole optimizer splits the entire assembly string into individual
heap-allocated String objects (one per line). For SQLite compilation, this
creates tens of thousands of small allocations per function, accounting for
a significant portion of malloc/free overhead (~15% of total compile time
is spent in malloc/free/realloc, much of it from peephole string operations).

Plan:
- Replace Vec<String> per-line storage with a contiguous byte buffer approach
- Keep the original assembly string and use (start, end) byte offsets for lines
- Use a small side buffer for mutated/replaced lines
- This avoids N heap allocations per function for the peephole optimizer

Expected impact: Measurable reduction in total compile time by cutting
heap allocation overhead in the peephole optimizer.
