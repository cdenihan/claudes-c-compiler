Fix i686 F128 (long double) cast handling

Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Problem:
On i686, the emit_cast function used classify_cast() which treats F128 as F64
(f128_is_native=false). This caused int-to-F128 casts to store the x87 result
as 8-byte F64 (fstpl) into a 12-byte F128 slot. When the value was later loaded
as F128 (fldt), it read garbage bytes, producing NaN values.

This affected all runtime int/float-to-long-double casts that went through
memory (e.g., array[i] = (long double)i in a loop), causing widespread test
failures in long double arithmetic tests.

Fix:
Changed classify_cast to classify_cast_with_f128(from_ty, to_ty, true) in
emit_cast(), routing F128 casts through the dedicated SignedToF128/UnsignedToF128/
FloatToF128/F128ToFloat/etc. paths that use fstpt (12-byte store) instead of
fstpl (8-byte store).

Impact: i686 test pass rate improved from 78.1% to 82.2% (111+ tests fixed).
