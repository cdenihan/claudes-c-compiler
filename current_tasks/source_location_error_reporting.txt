Task: Add source location tracking to error messages

Status: in_progress

What:
1. Emit GCC-style line markers (# linenum "filename") from the preprocessor
   at #include boundaries so the lexer can track which original file each
   token came from.
2. Parse these line markers in the lexer to register files with the
   SourceManager and update file_id/line tracking dynamically.
3. Pass the SourceManager to the parser so parse errors include
   file:line:column information.

Why:
Currently syntax errors print "error: expected X, got Y" with no file/line
information, making debugging impossible for users. The Span and SourceManager
infrastructure exists but is disconnected from error reporting.
