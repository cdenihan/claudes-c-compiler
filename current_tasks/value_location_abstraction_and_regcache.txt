Task: Introduce ValueLocation abstraction and cross-backend register value cache

This implements the HIGH PRIORITY idea from ideas/high_value_location_abstraction.txt:
introduce a ValueLocation enum with Stack and Register variants, and add a register
value cache to CodegenState that all three backends can use to skip redundant loads.

Key changes:
1. Add ValueLocation enum to state.rs (Stack(StackSlot) | Register(PhysReg))
2. Add register value cache to CodegenState tracking which values are in which registers
3. Update the shared ArchCodegen trait default methods to use the cache
4. Update x86, ARM, and RISC-V backends to invalidate/update the cache appropriately
5. This is the prerequisite for a future register allocator

This is NOT a full register allocator. It's the abstraction layer + a smart cache
that eliminates redundant stack loads at the source (all 3 backends).

Note: Related to but distinct from codegen_register_value_cache.txt which is
x86-only and operates at a different level.

Status: in progress
