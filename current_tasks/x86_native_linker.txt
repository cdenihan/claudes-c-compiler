LOCKED - Implementing a native x86-64 ELF linker in Rust.

When MY_LD is set, the compiler will use this built-in linker instead of
calling the system ld. The linker reads ELF .o files and .a archives, resolves
symbols against system shared libraries (libc.so.6), handles relocations, and
emits a dynamically-linked ELF executable.

Scope: x86-64 only for now. Must pass most verify_compiler.py test cases.
