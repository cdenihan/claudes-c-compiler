Fix ARM -mgeneral-regs-only flag (in_progress)

Problem: The compiler silently ignores -mgeneral-regs-only on ARM64.
This causes variadic functions to emit stp q0-q7 (FP/SIMD register saves)
in the prologue, which is forbidden in the Linux kernel (compiled with
-mgeneral-regs-only). This causes boot failures when kasprintf.c (and
other variadic kernel functions) are compiled with our compiler.

Fix:
1. Parse -mgeneral-regs-only and propagate to ARM backend
2. Skip q0-q7 saves in variadic function prologues when flag is set
3. Set __vr_offs to 0 in va_start (no FP save area)
4. Skip FP register area lookup in va_arg
5. Also skip any NEON/FP instructions used for popcount etc.
