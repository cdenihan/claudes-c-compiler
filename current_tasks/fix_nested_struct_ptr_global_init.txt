Fix type_has_pointer_elements to recurse into struct/union fields

The function type_has_pointer_elements() in global_init.rs only checks
for direct Pointer and Array(Pointer) types but doesn't recurse into
struct/union fields. This causes global arrays of structs with nested
pointer fields to have their pointers zeroed out instead of getting
proper relocations.

Affects: mbedtls ECP (secp256r1_T table), any global array of structs
containing nested struct pointer fields.
