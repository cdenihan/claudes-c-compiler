Fix x86 builtin assembler: add I/O and privileged instructions for kernel build

When building the Linux kernel with MY_ASM=builtin, the build fails because the
x86 builtin assembler is missing several I/O port and privileged instructions:
- inb, inw, inl (port input)
- outb, outw, outl (port output)
- insb, insw, insl (string port input)
- outsb, outsw, outsl (string port output)
- rdmsr, wrmsr (MSR read/write)
- sgdt (store GDT)
- prefetcht0 (cache prefetch)

These are all used extensively in the Linux kernel's inline assembly.
Goal: Make verify_kernel.py and verify_kernel_defconfig.py pass with MY_ASM=builtin.
