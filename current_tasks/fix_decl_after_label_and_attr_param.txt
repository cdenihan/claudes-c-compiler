Task: Fix declaration-after-label parsing + __attribute__ after * in param declarators
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

Two parser bugs:

1. Declarations directly after labels (e.g. `skip: int x = 5;`) fail because
   parse_stmt() doesn't check is_type_specifier() after parsing a label. Falls
   through to expression parsing, producing "unexpected token" errors. Affects
   _Thread_local, static, int, etc. after any label. C23 makes this standard;
   GCC/Clang already support it.

2. __attribute__ after * in parameter declarators is not consumed. The param
   declarator path only calls skip_cv_qualifiers() after *, not skip_gcc_extensions().
   This causes parse failures for patterns like `int f(int * __attribute__((unused)) p)`.
