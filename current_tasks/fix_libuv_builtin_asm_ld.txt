LOCKED: Fix libuv with MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin on x86

Two bugs:
1. x86/i686 builtin assembler: "rep; nop" (pause) fails because "rep" appears as
   standalone mnemonic after semicolon splitting. Fix: handle rep/repz/repnz/lock
   as standalone instructions that emit just the prefix byte.
2. x86/RISC-V builtin linker: -l:filename syntax not handled. The colon prefix means
   "search for exact filename" rather than lib<name>.so/lib<name>.a pattern.
   Fix: detect ':' prefix and use exact filename search.
