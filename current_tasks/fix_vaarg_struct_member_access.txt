Fix va_arg() struct member access bug

Bug: `va_arg(ap, struct_type).field` produces wrong results (segfault/garbage)
when the struct is small (<= 8 bytes).

Root cause: `expr_produces_packed_struct_data()` in structs.rs does not handle
the `Expr::VaArg` case. When `get_struct_base_addr()` processes a VaArg
expression in the catch-all `_ =>` branch, it fails to detect that VaArg
returns packed struct data (not an address), so the subsequent member access
treats the packed value as a pointer and dereferences it.

Fix: Add `Expr::VaArg` to `expr_produces_packed_struct_data()` so it returns
true for small struct VaArg results. This causes `get_struct_base_addr()` to
spill the packed value to an alloca before member access, which is the correct
behavior (same as small struct function call returns).

Affects all three architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V).
