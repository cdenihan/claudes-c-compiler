Task: Fix ARM miscompilation of mm/vmscan.c causing kernel boot hang

Status: in_progress

Problem:
When mm/vmscan.c is compiled with ccc-arm and swapped into a GCC-built kernel,
the kernel hangs during boot. mm/vmscan.c is the virtual memory scanner, a critical
kernel component responsible for page reclamation.

The DD tool found this is a single-file failure — compiling just this one file
with our compiler causes a boot hang (400s timeout, no crash message).

Plan:
1. Compare GCC vs CCC assembly output for mm/vmscan.c
2. Identify the miscompiled function(s)
3. Write a minimal reproducer
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with DD tool
6. Add regression test
