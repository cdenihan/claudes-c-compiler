Task: Fix x86 assembler crash for kernel defconfig in standalone mode

Bug: relax_jumps() shrinks section data but does not update deferred_skips
and deferred_byte_diffs offsets. This causes resolve_deferred_skips() to
panic with "range end index out of range" when the stale offsets point past
the shortened data.

Fix: Update deferred_skips and deferred_byte_diffs offsets during jump
relaxation, matching the pattern used for relocations and alignment markers.
