Task: Fix static local variable scoping, incomplete array typedef, and float conditions
Status: COMPLETED

Fixes implemented:
1. Static local variables: Don't emit GlobalAddr at declaration point (which may be
   in an unreachable block due to goto/switch). Instead, store the global name in
   LocalInfo and emit a fresh GlobalAddr at each use site.
   Also fixed extern within block to properly remove from static_local_names.

   Tests fixed:
   - wacc_chapter_10_valid_extra_credit_goto_skip_static_initializer
   - wacc_chapter_10_valid_extra_credit_switch_skip_static_initializer
   - wacc_chapter_10_valid_shadow_static_local_var

2. Incomplete array type via typedef: Fixed is_unsized_array detection to check
   resolved typedef type, and fixed base_ty computation for typedef'd arrays.

   Tests fixed:
   - compiler_suite_0030_0114

3. Float condition branching: Added lower_condition_expr() that masks off the sign
   bit for floating-point values used as conditions (if/while/for/do-while/ternary/
   logical operators). This ensures -0.0 is falsy and NaN is truthy, without needing
   FP comparison which mishandles NaN via ucomisd parity flag.
   Also fixed LogicalNot (!) for float operands.

   Tests fixed:
   - wacc_chapter_19_whole_pipeline_all_types_fold_negative_zero

Results:
  x86 wacc: 697 → 701 (+4)
  ARM wacc: 697 → 701 (+4)
  RISC-V wacc: 695 → 699 (+4)
  No regressions on any architecture.
