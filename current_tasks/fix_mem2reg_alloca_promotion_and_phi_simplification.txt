Fix mem2reg alloca promotion and Phi simplification for dead code elimination

Problem:
- Kernel boot failure caused by undefined reference to folio_undo_large_rmappable
  and free_zone_device_page in mm/swap.c
- The root cause: static inline functions returning constant false/0 were not
  having their dead code eliminated after inlining

Three bugs found and fixed:

1. Short-circuit &&/|| and ternary ?: allocas were emitted into the current
   block using self.emit(Alloca), not the entry block. When these expressions
   appeared inside loops/branches, the alloca was in a non-entry block and
   mem2reg refused to promote it, preventing constant propagation through Phi.
   Fix: Use emit_entry_alloca() instead.

2. mem2reg rejected allocas where size > ir_type_size (e.g., int with ty=I32
   but size=8 due to .max(8) in scalar alloc sizing). Fix: allow promotion
   when size <= 8 and type_size <= 8.

3. Phi simplification compared IrConst values by hash key, which treats
   I32(0) and I64(0) as different. After constant folding produces I32(0)
   from Cmp and the default && value is I64(0), the Phi has two "zeros"
   of different types that weren't recognized as equal. Fix: compare
   integer constants numerically.
