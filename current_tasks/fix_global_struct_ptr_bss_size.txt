Fix global struct pointer BSS size and -rdynamic flag forwarding

Two bugs preventing postgres initdb from completing:

1. Global variables declared as `struct Foo *ptr;` get BSS allocation of
   sizeof(struct Foo) instead of sizeof(pointer). This causes BSS symbols
   to overlap, corrupting heap-allocated strings like file paths.

2. `-rdynamic` flag was silently ignored instead of being forwarded to the
   linker, so dynamic symbols weren't exported. This prevented dlopen'd
   shared libraries (like dict_snowball.so) from resolving symbols.

Status: LOCKED (fix in progress)
