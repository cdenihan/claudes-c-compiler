Fix _Alignas and __attribute__((aligned(N))) on struct/union members

Currently both _Alignas(N) and __attribute__((aligned(N))) on struct/union
member declarations are parsed but the alignment values are discarded.
This causes incorrect struct layout: member offsets and struct sizes/alignments
don't account for per-field alignment requirements.

Plan:
1. Add `alignment: Option<usize>` to StructField and StructFieldDecl
2. Parse _Alignas(N) values instead of skip_balanced_parens()
3. Wire __attribute__((aligned(N))) through to struct field alignment
4. Update StructLayout::for_struct_with_packing to use per-field alignment
5. Update for_union similarly
6. Also handle _Alignas on the struct type itself
