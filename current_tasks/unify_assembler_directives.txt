Unify assembler directive handling across all four backends.

Key changes:
1. Add .balign support to x86 assembler (ARM and RISC-V already support it)
2. Add .zero/.skip fill byte support to x86 assembler (ARM and RISC-V already support it)
3. Add .local directive to x86 parser (ARM and RISC-V already parse it)
4. Add .equ alias for .set in x86 parser (ARM and RISC-V already support it)
5. Add .space alias for .zero in x86 parser (ARM and RISC-V already support it)
6. Fix ARM assembler code section alignment to use NOP (0xD503201F) instead of zero bytes
7. Add missing data directive aliases (.hword/.half for .short, .word for .long) to x86 parser
