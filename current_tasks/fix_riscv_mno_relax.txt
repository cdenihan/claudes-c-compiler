Fix RISC-V -mno-relax: suppress R_RISCV_RELAX relocations

Bug: Our compiler ignores -mno-relax, always emitting assembly that causes the
GNU assembler to generate R_RISCV_RELAX relocation entries. When building the
Linux kernel's EFI stub (which requires -fpic -mno-relax), these RELAX hints
allow the linker to convert PIC references to absolute ones, causing:
  "absolute symbol references not allowed in the EFI stub"

Fix:
1. Parse -mno-relax CLI flag and store it in Driver
2. Add no_relax field to CodegenOptions
3. Emit ".option norelax" in RISC-V assembly preamble when no_relax is set
4. Pass -mno-relax to the assembler via build_asm_extra_args

Status: in_progress
