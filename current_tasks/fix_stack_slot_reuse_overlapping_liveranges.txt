Task: Fix stack slot reuse bug where overlapping live ranges share same slot
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
When compiling lz4hc.c's LZ4HC_compress_optimal function, the register allocator
assigns the same stack slot (-0x118(%rbp)) to two different values with overlapping
live ranges. The `limit` parameter is pre-computed and stored at this slot, but
later a different temporary overwrites the same slot. When the `_last_literals`
section reads back the limit value, it gets the wrong value.

This causes lz4 fuzzer test 55 to fail:
  "one missing byte for output buffer (expected 40563, but result=40562)"

The compressed output is 1 byte short because the limitedOutput check uses
a corrupted value and falls through to the fillOutput path instead of returning
failure.

This is a fundamental register allocator bug in stack slot assignment, not
optimization-specific (reproduces at -O0 through -O3).

Affects: lz4 project (test 55), likely other projects with complex functions
