Implement -fPIC position-independent code generation with GOT-relative addressing.

PostgreSQL build fails when linking shared libraries because object files use
R_X86_64_PC32 relocations against external symbols instead of GOT-indirect
addressing. The linker error is:
  "relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against undefined symbol 'CurrentMemoryContext'
   can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC"

Tasks:
1. Parse -fPIC/-fpic flags in driver, propagate to codegen
2. In x86 codegen PIC mode: access external/global symbols via GOT
   - Load: mov sym@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax; then dereference
   - Instead of: lea sym(%rip), %rax (direct PC-relative)
3. Emit R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX / R_X86_64_REX_GOTPCRELX relocations
4. Handle function calls in PIC mode (call via PLT: call sym@PLT)
5. Add -shared linker flag support for producing .so files
