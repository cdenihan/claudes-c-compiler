Task: IR Strength Reduction and Enhanced Simplification Pass

Objective: Improve code quality by adding strength reduction and additional
simplifications to the IR optimization passes, targeting patterns found in
real-world code (zlib, libjpeg).

Changes planned:
1. Multiply by power-of-2 -> shift left (e.g., x * 4 -> x << 2)
2. Divide by power-of-2 -> shift right (unsigned: x / 4 -> x >> 2)
3. Redundant Cast elimination (cast to same type)
4. GEP with zero offset elimination
5. Add+0 via GEP elimination

These are all IR-level changes in src/passes/simplify.rs that benefit
all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V).

Status: in progress
