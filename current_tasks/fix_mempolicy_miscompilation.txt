Task: Fix mm/mempolicy.c miscompilation causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

The kernel file mm/mempolicy.c (NUMA memory policy management) is being miscompiled
by ccc, causing a boot failure. Need to identify the root cause by comparing ccc and
gcc output and fix the compiler bug.
