Task: Fix dead statics pass not preserving globals referenced by address-taken functions

Status: in_progress (started 2026-01-30)

When a static always_inline function is kept in the dead statics elimination pass
because its address is taken (e.g., passed as a function pointer), the globals
referenced by that function are not being marked as reachable. The BFS reachability
analysis only propagates through reachable functions, but address-taken functions
may not be BFS-reachable even though they survive the elimination pass.

This causes `static const` globals like `XXH_PRIME32_1` in xxhash.h to be incorrectly
removed, leading to undefined symbol errors at link time.

Example: flatcc project's ptr_set.c includes xxhash.h and passes XXH3_scrambleAcc_scalar
as a function pointer. The function is kept (address_taken=true) but its referenced
global XXH_PRIME32_1 is removed (reachable=false).

Fix: After determining which functions survive (Phase 5), do a second pass to mark
all globals referenced by surviving functions as reachable too.
