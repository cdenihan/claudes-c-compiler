Task: Fix pointer arithmetic to scale by pointed-to type size
Status: In Progress

Problem:
Pointer arithmetic (p + n, p - n, p++, p--) does not scale by the size of the
pointed-to type. For example, if p is int*, then p + 1 should add sizeof(int)=4
bytes to the address, but currently it adds 1 byte.

This causes wrong results for:
- pointer increment/decrement (p++, p--)
- pointer addition/subtraction (p + n, p - n)
- pointer difference (p1 - p2 should divide by sizeof)
- array subscript via pointer (equivalent to *(p + i))

The fix is in ir/lowering/expr.rs to multiply the offset by the element size
when lowering pointer arithmetic operations (BinaryOp::Add, Sub on pointer types,
and UnaryOp::PreInc, PreDec, PostInc, PostDec on pointer types).

Also need to check that p[i] indexing (already via GEP) properly scales.

Files to modify:
