Task: Fix PIC/PIE jump table emission for ARM and RISC-V backends
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
The ARM and RISC-V backends emit absolute .xword/.dword entries in jump tables
(.rodata section). When compiling with -fpie/-fpic, this generates R_AARCH64_ABS64
/ R_RISCV_64 relocations. The Linux kernel's EFI stub linker rejects these:
  "absolute symbol references not allowed in the EFI stub"

This was found via delta debugging on ARM with
drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/gop.c (compiled with -fpie).

Fix:
In PIC mode, emit relative jump table entries (.word target - table_base)
and compute the jump target as table_base + sign_extended_offset.
This matches what GCC does and what the x86 backend already implements.

Files to modify:
- src/backend/arm/codegen/codegen.rs (emit_switch_jump_table)
- src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs (emit_switch_jump_table)
