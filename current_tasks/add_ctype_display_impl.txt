Task: Add Display trait implementation for CType
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Goal:
Implement std::fmt::Display for CType to produce user-friendly C-style type names
in diagnostic messages (e.g., "unsigned int" instead of "UInt", "char *" instead
of "Pointer(Char)").

This is item #3 from the structured error infrastructure follow-ups in
ideas/low_structured_error_infrastructure.txt.

Changes:
- Add Display impl for CType in common/types.rs
- Update diagnostic sites to use {} instead of {:?} for CType
- Update the ideas file to mark this as completed
