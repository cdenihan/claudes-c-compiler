Uplift emit_cmp dispatch skeleton to shared trait default implementation.

Currently emit_cmp has no default implementation in ArchCodegen, forcing all three
backends (x86, arm, riscv) to duplicate the same dispatch skeleton:
  1. if i128 → delegate to emit_i128_cmp
  2. if F128 → delegate to emit_f128_cmp
  3. if float → delegate to emit_float_cmp
  4. else → delegate to emit_int_cmp

This refactoring will:
1. Add a default emit_cmp() in ArchCodegen that does the dispatch
2. Add new primitive trait methods: emit_float_cmp, emit_f128_cmp, emit_int_cmp
3. Move each backend's type-specific cmp code into these new primitives
4. Remove the duplicated dispatch from all three backends

This is the same pattern already used for emit_binop (dispatches i128/float/int)
and emit_unaryop.
