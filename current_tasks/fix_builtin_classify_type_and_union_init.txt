Task: Fix __builtin_classify_type and union zero-initialization

1. Implement __builtin_classify_type as a compile-time constant
   - GCC returns: 0=void, 1=integer, 2=char, 5=pointer, 8=real(float/double),
     9=complex, 12=struct, 13=union, 14=array, 15=function
   - Currently recognized in type_checker but not lowered - causes link error
   - Needs to be evaluated at compile time based on argument type

2. Fix union zero-initialization for remaining bytes
   - When a union is initialized with {expr}, bytes beyond the first member
     should be zero-initialized per C standard
   - Currently only initializes the first member, leaves rest as stack garbage
   - Test: compiler_suite_0011_0161

3. Fix global pointer to interior of 2D array element
   - int a[6][9] = {}, *c = &a[3][5]; produces wrong address
   - Test: gcc_torture_pr57568
