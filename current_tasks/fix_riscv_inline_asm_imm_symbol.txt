Task: Fix RISC-V inline asm immediate symbol operand handling
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Bug: RISC-V backend's format_operand() doesn't handle imm_symbol
(string literal / symbol references in "i" constraint operands).
When __FILE__ or other string literals are used as "i" constraint
operands in inline asm, the RISC-V backend emits "0" instead of
the symbol label (e.g., .Lstr0).

This causes ~42 kernel compile failures on RISC-V, including
kernel/softirq.c, kernel/fork.c, etc. — any file using BUG_ON()
or WARN() macros.

Fix: Add op_imm_symbols array to RISC-V format_operand() and
substitute_riscv_asm_operands(), mirroring the ARM backend's
approach.
