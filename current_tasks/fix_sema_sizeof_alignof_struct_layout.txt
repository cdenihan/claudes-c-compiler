Task: Fix sizeof_type_spec and alignof_type_spec returning wrong values for struct/union types

Root cause of PostgreSQL bind() EFAULT and likely other ABI issues.

Problem:
sizeof_type_spec() in sema.rs had a catch-all `_ => 8` that returned hardcoded 8
for ALL struct/union/typedef types instead of looking up their actual cached layout sizes.
alignof_type_spec() had the same `_ => 8` catch-all problem.

This caused incorrect array dimension computation when array sizes use sizeof(struct_type)
in their dimension expression (like struct sockaddr_in's sin_zero padding field).
The wrong array dimension propagated into cached struct layouts, causing ABI mismatches
when structs were passed to functions.

Fix:
1. sizeof_type_spec: Already fixed to look up struct/union layouts, resolve typedefs,
   compute inline struct sizes, and handle complex/enum types correctly.
2. alignof_type_spec: Updated to match - look up struct/union alignment from cached
   layouts, resolve typedefs via align_ctx(), handle all type specifiers properly.

Status: IN PROGRESS
