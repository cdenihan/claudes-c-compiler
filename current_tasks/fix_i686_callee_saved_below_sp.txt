Task: Fix i686 callee-saved register saves below stack pointer
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Problem:
The i686 backend's emit_prologue saves callee-saved registers (ebx, esi, edi)
at offsets -(frame_size + (i+1)*4)(%ebp), which is BELOW the stack pointer
(esp = ebp - frame_size). Since i686 has no red zone, these saves can be
overwritten by any function call or interrupt, corrupting callee-saved
registers.

This causes Lua to crash in lua_newstate where preinit_thread corrupts esi.

Fix:
Include the callee-saved register save area in the stack allocation so that
saves are within the allocated frame (above esp).
