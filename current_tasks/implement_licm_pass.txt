Implement Loop-Invariant Code Motion (LICM) optimization pass

Add an IR-level LICM pass that identifies natural loops and hoists
loop-invariant computations to loop preheaders. This is a major
optimization for code with loops (matrix multiply, compression, etc.)
where expressions like i*n get recomputed on every iteration.

Key steps:
1. Add natural loop detection (back edges, loop body identification)
2. Identify loop-invariant instructions (operands defined outside loop or
   by other loop-invariant instructions)
3. Create preheader blocks for hoisting targets
4. Move eligible instructions to preheaders
5. Integrate into the pass pipeline at -O2 and above

This helps all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V) since it operates at IR level.
