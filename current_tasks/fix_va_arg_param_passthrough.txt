Fix va_arg on va_list passed as function parameter (ARM/x86-64 broken)

On AArch64 and x86-64, va_list is an array type (char[32] / char[24]).
When passed as a function parameter, it decays to a pointer. The va_arg
lowering used lower_address_of which returned the address of the local slot
holding the pointer (pointer-to-pointer), instead of the pointer value itself
(pointer-to-struct). This caused va_arg to read from garbage stack memory.

Fix: use lower_expr for x86-64/AArch64 (handles both local array decay and
parameter pointer load correctly), keep lower_address_of for RISC-V where
va_list is a scalar void* that needs its address for read-modify-write.

This fixes Lua ARM tests (print(1+2) was outputting garbage pointer values)
and all programs using va_list parameter passing (e.g. vfprintf wrappers).
