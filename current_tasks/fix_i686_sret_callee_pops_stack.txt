Fix i686 sret callee-pops stack cleanup in emit_call

Problem:
The i686 emit_call override bypasses the default trait's callee_pops_bytes_for_sret
adjustment. When an sret call is made (function returning large struct via hidden pointer),
the callee does `ret $4` to pop the sret pointer, but the caller still cleans up the full
stack_arg_space without subtracting those 4 bytes. This corrupts the stack.

This affects complex double returns (16 bytes = sret on i686) when the calling function
also uses sret, causing stack misalignment and zero returns.

Fix:
Apply callee_pops_bytes_for_sret subtraction in i686's emit_call override, matching the
default trait implementation.

Status: in_progress
