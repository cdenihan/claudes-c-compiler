Bug: get_expr_ctype_lowerer does not apply integer promotion for unary Neg/Plus/BitNot

The lowerer's CType inference for unary negation, plus, and bitwise NOT returned the
operand's CType without applying integer promotion (C11 6.3.1.1). For small unsigned types
(unsigned char, unsigned short), this caused the CType to remain e.g. UChar instead of Int.

When the result of -(unsigned_char_var) was then converted to _Complex long double via
real_to_complex(), the IrType was derived from UChar (U8) instead of Int (I32). This caused
the negated I32 value (0xFFFFFFF6 = -10) to be truncated to U8 (0xF6 = 246), producing
246.0 instead of -10.0 in the complex conversion.

Fix: Apply integer_promoted() in get_expr_ctype_lowerer for Neg/Plus/BitNot arms when the
operand type is an integer. Also removed the now-redundant BitNot arm that was later in the
same match block.

Status: in_progress
