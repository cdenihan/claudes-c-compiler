Fix statement expression (GCC extension) returning wrong type for float/double values.

get_expr_type() did not handle StmtExpr or CompoundLiteral, falling through to
the catch-all IrType::I64. This caused float/double values from statement
expressions to be spuriously cast from I64->F64 (reinterpreting the float bit
pattern as an integer), producing garbage results. Affects the common MAX/MIN
macro pattern using typeof + statement expressions.

Status: IN PROGRESS
