Task: Fix #if directives not processed during multi-line accumulation in included files

Problem:
When processing included files, the preprocessor skips #if/#endif directives
if there's a pending multi-line accumulation (unbalanced parentheses from a
previous line). This causes #if conditions to leak through as literal text
in the preprocessed output, resulting in parse errors.

Example from libjpeg-turbo's turbojpeg-mp.c (included via #include):
  if (
  #if ULLONG_MAX > SIZE_MAX
      (unsigned long long)pitch > (unsigned long long)((size_t)-1) ||
  #endif
      malloc(...) == NULL)

The "if (" on one line creates unbalanced parens, then "#if ULLONG_MAX > SIZE_MAX"
on the next line is not recognized as a directive (treated as regular text), so
it survives into preprocessed output as "#if (9223372036854775807LL ...) > ...".

Fix:
Conditional directives (#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else, #endif) are now
always processed regardless of pending multi-line accumulation state. When a
conditional directive is encountered during accumulation in an included file,
the pending line is flushed first before processing the directive.

Real-world impact: Fixes libjpeg-turbo build (turbojpeg-mp.c included via
#include "turbojpeg-mp.c" pattern). libjpeg-turbo now passes all tests.

Status: Completed
