Fix enum constants to support values beyond 32-bit range.

Problem: When an enum constant value exceeds INT_MAX (e.g. 4294967296LL),
the compiler truncates it to 32-bit int, losing the high bits.
GCC/Clang promote the underlying enum type to long long in this case.

This causes test failures on all architectures:
- compiler_suite_0048_0286: Tests 11-14 fail because enum values > 2^32
  are truncated to int instead of being promoted to long long.

Fix: Update sema to detect when enum values overflow int/unsigned int range
and promote the underlying type to long long / unsigned long long.
