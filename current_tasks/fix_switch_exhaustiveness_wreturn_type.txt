Fix switch exhaustiveness analysis in -Wreturn-type

The -Wreturn-type warning treats ALL switch statements as potentially falling
through (line 911 of sema.rs: `Stmt::Switch(_, _, _) => true`). This causes
false positives for switch statements where every case (including default)
returns a value. This is the critical blocker for the Linux kernel build.

Examples from the kernel:
  - sigisemptyset() in include/linux/signal.h (switch with default, all cases return)
  - op_is_zone_mgmt() in include/linux/blk_types.h (switch with default, all cases return)
  - __screen_info_video_type() in include/linux/screen_info.h (switch with default, all cases return)

Fix: Add switch exhaustiveness analysis to stmt_can_fall_through() that checks
if the switch has a default case and ALL case groups (segments of consecutive
case labels followed by statements) either return, break, goto, or otherwise
diverge.

NOTE: This overlaps with fix_wreturn_type_comprehensive and
fix_wreturn_type_switch_false_positive which were locked but not completed.
This fix covers only the switch exhaustiveness portion.
