Task: Refactor emit_globals and emit_const_data in backend/common.rs
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Goal: Clean up the two most verbose/duplicated areas in backend/common.rs:

1. emit_globals: Replace 7 filtering passes over the globals array (each with
   duplicated guard conditions like is_extern/section.is_some/is_thread_local)
   with a single classify-then-emit pattern. Classify each global into its
   target section once, then emit each section group.

2. emit_const_data: Eliminate the 4x4 type-widening matrix where I8/I16/I32/I64
   constant arms each contain identical match-on-ty logic. Extract the common
   widening pattern into a helper that takes the integer value and emits the
   correctly-sized directive.

Both changes are purely internal refactoring with no behavioral changes.
