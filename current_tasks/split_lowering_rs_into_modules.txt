Split lowering.rs (2241 lines) into focused sub-modules

Problem: lowering.rs conflates 6+ distinct concerns in one file:
- Type/data struct definitions (VarInfo, LocalInfo, GlobalInfo, DeclAnalysis, etc.)
- FunctionBuildState and its scope management methods
- TypeContext and its scope management methods
- IR emission helpers (fresh_value, emit_binop_val, etc.)
- Function lowering pipeline (lower_function, build_ir_params, etc.)
- Global declaration lowering (lower_global_decl)
- Declaration analysis (analyze_declaration, fixup_unsized_array)
- Top-level orchestration (lower())

Plan:
1. Extract type/data definitions into lowering/definitions.rs
2. Extract FunctionBuildState + scope mgmt into lowering/func_state.rs
3. Extract TypeContext + scope mgmt into lowering/type_context.rs
4. Keep Lowerer struct, constructor, orchestration (lower()), IR helpers,
   function lowering, global decl lowering, and analysis in lowering.rs (much smaller)
5. Update mod.rs with new modules
6. Update lowering/README.md
