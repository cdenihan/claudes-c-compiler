Extract FunctionBuildState from Lowerer (Commit 2 of lowerer decomposition)

Pull per-function-being-compiled fields into a sub-struct FunctionBuildState.
The Lowerer holds Option<FunctionBuildState> — None between functions, Some during lowering.
All self.current_blocks accesses become self.func().blocks, etc.
This makes the function-vs-module state boundary explicit.
