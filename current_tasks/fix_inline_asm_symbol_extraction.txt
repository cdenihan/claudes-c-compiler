Fix inline asm extract_symbol_name returning local variable/parameter names

Problem:
- extract_symbol_name() in ir/lowering/stmt.rs extracts ANY identifier name,
  including local variables and function parameters
- When used with inline asm "i" constraints (e.g., "i" (key) where key is a
  function parameter), this causes local parameter names to be emitted as
  assembly symbols (e.g., "key + branch - ." instead of actual addresses)
- This produces invalid assembly that the assembler rejects with
  "invalid operands (*UND* and *UND* sections) for `+'"
- Affects nearly ALL kernel files due to the jump_label mechanism
  (arch_static_branch) which uses inline asm with "i" constraints

Fix:
- Make extract_symbol_name check whether the identifier is a global symbol
  or known function, filtering out local variables/parameters
- This allows the fallback in inline_asm.rs (lines 308-322) to properly
  emit $0 placeholder for pure "i" constraints that can't be resolved
