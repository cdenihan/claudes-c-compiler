Fix: Place const-qualified global/static variables in .rodata instead of .data

Implementation:
1. Added is_const field to IrGlobal struct
2. Set it during IR lowering from Declaration.is_const at all 3 construction sites
3. In emit_globals (backend/common.rs), const globals are emitted to .rodata
4. All const globals go to .rodata (not .data.rel.ro) to match GCC -fno-PIE behavior
5. Added has_relocations() helper to GlobalInit for future use

This fixes 10+ kernel boot failures found via bisect testing.
