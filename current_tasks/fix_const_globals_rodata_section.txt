Fix: Place const-qualified global/static variables in .rodata instead of .data

Problem: The compiler places all initialized global variables in the .data section,
including those with const qualification. GCC correctly places const globals in .rodata.

This causes kernel boot failures because:
- The kernel relies on .data and .rodata having different memory permissions
- Many kernel headers declare `static const` variables (e.g., cc_mask in asm/coco.h)
- When these end up in .data instead of .rodata, it changes memory layout and can
  break kernel page table expectations

Fix approach:
1. Add is_const field to IrGlobal struct
2. Set it during IR lowering based on the Declaration's is_const flag
3. In emit_globals (backend/common.rs), emit const globals to .rodata instead of .data
4. For const globals with relocations (GlobalAddr, etc.), use .data.rel.ro

This affects 10+ kernel files that were causing boot failures in bisect testing.
