Fix two bugs that cause libffi closure test segfault:

1. __CET__ predefined macro missing: GCC defines __CET__=3 (CET: IBT+SHSTK) on x86_64,
   but our compiler did not. Since we delegate .S file assembly to GCC, the assembly
   trampolines in libffi use ENDBR_PRESENT (40-byte trampolines) while C code compiled
   by our compiler used non-ENDBR (32-byte trampolines). This size mismatch caused the
   static trampoline parameter blocks to be at wrong offsets, leading to jumping to NULL.
   Fix: define __CET__=3 in predefined macros for x86_64 only.

2. visibility("hidden") attribute not propagated for function definitions: The parser
   captured visibility attributes but only passed them to parse_declaration_rest, not
   to parse_function_def. This meant functions defined with visibility("hidden") inline
   attribute did not get .hidden directives in assembly output. configure scripts that
   check for hidden visibility support by compiling with -S and grepping for .hidden
   would detect it as unsupported.
   Fix: add visibility field to FunctionDef AST, IrFunction IR, and emit .hidden in
   generate_function().
