Fix RISC-V va_arg for struct containing long double (misaligned stack)

When a struct containing a long double is passed as a variadic argument on
the stack (all registers exhausted), va_arg reads garbage instead of the
correct value. The issue is that long double (f128) structs need 16-byte
alignment when read from the va_list stack area, but the current va_arg
implementation doesn't properly align the stack pointer before reading.

Test case: compiler_suite_0172_0039, specifically test_misalign_r10
