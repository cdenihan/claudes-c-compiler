Fix i686 TCC build: environment setup for i686 cross-compilation
================================================================
Status: in_progress

Problem: TCC build on i686 fails (1/78 tests pass) because:
1. TCC's configure script uses `uname -m` which returns x86_64 on the host,
   causing TCC to be compiled with x86_64 codegen instead of i386
2. The i386 sysroot (CRT files, headers) is not at the standard triplet path
   `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/` - it's at `/usr/i686-linux-gnu/lib/`

Fix:
1. Create i386 sysroot symlinks at standard triplet locations
2. Create a smart uname wrapper that detects i686 cross-compilation context
3. Add a setup script to the repo for reproducibility

Expected result: 76/78 tests pass (2 bitfield tests have arch-specific expected output)
