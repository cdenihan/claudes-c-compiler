Task: Implement __attribute__((fastcall)) calling convention for i686 backend
Status: in_progress

Problem: libffi on i686 crashes because ffi_call_i386 is declared with __attribute__((fastcall))
but our compiler silently ignores it, generating cdecl code instead. The function expects
its first two integer args in ecx/edx registers, but gets them on the stack.

Plan:
1. Parse __attribute__((fastcall)) in the parser, store as a function attribute
2. Propagate through sema, IR lowering, and into function IR metadata
3. Implement fastcall convention in i686 codegen:
   - Callee: Read first two int args from ecx/edx instead of stack
   - Caller: Put first two int args in ecx/edx instead of pushing to stack
