Task: Implement -fomit-frame-pointer for i686
Status: in_progress

Implement ESP-relative addressing when omit_frame_pointer is true:
1. Skip push/pop %ebp in prologue/epilogue
2. Convert all slot references from EBP-relative to ESP-relative
3. Track ESP adjustments during call sequences
4. Add EBP as 4th allocatable register when FP omitted
5. Update peephole optimizer for ESP-relative addressing
6. Adjust param access offsets (no pushed EBP)

Expected impact: ~10-15% code size reduction for Linux boot code
