Task: Implement -fomit-frame-pointer for i686
Status: complete

Implemented ESP-relative addressing when omit_frame_pointer is true:
1. Skip push/pop %ebp in prologue/epilogue
2. Convert all 214+ slot references from EBP-relative to ESP-relative via slot_ref()/param_ref()
3. Track ESP adjustments during call sequences, push/pop pairs, and callee-pops-sret
4. Add EBP as 4th allocatable callee-saved register when FP omitted (PhysReg(3))
5. Update peephole optimizer to exempt (%esp) from indirect memory detection
6. Adjust param access offsets (no pushed EBP shifts params by -4)
7. Disable FP omission when function uses dynamic alloca (VLAs)
8. Enable by default at -O1+ (matching GCC behavior)

Files modified: 14 files across i686 codegen + driver/cli.rs
Test results: 12/12 i686 projects passing, 2724/2737 sample tests (99.5%)
