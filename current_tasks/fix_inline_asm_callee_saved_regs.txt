Fix: Inline asm callee-saved register preservation

Bug: When inline asm uses callee-saved registers via specific constraints
(e.g., "b" for rbx on x86-64), the function prologue/epilogue doesn't
save/restore those registers. This causes callee-saved register corruption
visible to the caller.

Root cause: The register allocator is completely disabled for functions with
inline asm (returning empty used_regs). The inline asm framework correctly
assigns specific registers but doesn't propagate that information to the
prologue/epilogue generator.

Fix: After inline asm operand processing, collect all callee-saved registers
used by specific constraints or listed in clobbers, and ensure they're saved
in the function prologue/epilogue.

Impact: Fixes mbedtls MPI multiplication failure (and cascade: RSA, ECP,
ECJPAKE tests). The mbedtls bn_mul.h uses inline asm with "b" constraint
(rbx) for bignum multiply-accumulate.

Applies to: x86-64, AArch64, and RISC-V backends.
