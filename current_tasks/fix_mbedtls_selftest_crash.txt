Fix mbedtls selftest crash in mbedtls_cipher_info_from_values

Problem: After fixing the preprocessor phase ordering and attribute parsing,
mbedtls library builds successfully but the selftest program crashes with
SIGSEGV in mbedtls_cipher_info_from_values() called from mbedtls_gcm_setkey().

This is a codegen issue - the library compiles but the generated code has a
bug when looking up cipher info from a table.

Also includes: fix parse_gcc_attributes to properly handle nested parens
in __aligned__() arguments (e.g. _Alignof(long double)).

Status: In progress
