Task: Add Meson/GCC-compatible compiler identification for QEMU build support

Goal: Make the compiler recognized by Meson as a GCC-compatible compiler, which is
required to build QEMU (which uses Meson as its build system).

Changes:
1. Fix --version output to include "Free Software Foundation" (Meson checks this string)
2. Fix --version to work when other flags are present (Meson runs `ccc -m64 --version`)
3. Add -dM flag support (-E -dM) to dump all preprocessor defines (Meson uses this)
4. Add MacroTable iterator to support enumerating all defined macros

Status: in_progress
