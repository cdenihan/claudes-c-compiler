Fix x86 assembler: .previous directive incorrectly mapped to PopSection

Bug: The x86 assembler parser maps .previous to AsmItem::PopSection (same as .popsection).
These are different operations:
- .popsection pops the section stack (from .pushsection)
- .previous swaps current and previous sections (toggles between last two)

Impact: After ".section .export_symbol" / ".previous", the assembler stays in .export_symbol
instead of switching back to .text. This causes kernel modpost to fail with
"__ex_table references non-executable section .export_symbol" errors.

Fix: Add AsmItem::Previous variant and handle it by swapping current/previous sections.
