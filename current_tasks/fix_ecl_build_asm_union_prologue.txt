Fix ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp) build: inline asm '%' commutative constraint,
union static initializer brace elision, and RISC-V prologue narrow-store.

Bugs fixed:
1. Inline asm '%' (commutative) constraint modifier not stripped across all backends
   - GMP's umul_ppmm/udiv_qrnnd macros use "%0" meaning "tied to output 0, commutative"
   - The '%' was not being stripped from constraint strings in 13+ locations
2. Union static initializer brace elision in compound/ptrs path
   - C11 6.7.9p13-17: when a union field is itself a struct/union, and the
     initializer omits braces, we must consume nested fields one at a time
3. RISC-V prologue: store full register width to avoid uninitialized upper bytes

Status: in_progress
