Task: Fix inline asm alloca register input loading regression
Status: in_progress

Commit 2e817b3 incorrectly removed the is_alloca check from inline asm
register input loading in all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V).

When an alloca value is used as a register input to inline asm, the
codegen must compute the ADDRESS of the alloca (leaq/add) because the
IR value of an alloca represents a pointer to the allocated memory.
The commit changed this to always load the VALUE from the slot, which
is wrong for allocas - it loads the contents of the array/variable
instead of its address.

This causes musl's tmpfile() to break because it passes (long)s where
s is a stack char array to an inline asm syscall. The syscall receives
the string contents as a "pointer" instead of the actual address.

Fix: Restore the is_alloca check in load_input_to_register for all
three backends.
