Fix musl build with MY_ASM=builtin on x86

Problem: assemble_source_file() in external_tools.rs doesn't handle MY_ASM=builtin.
When MY_ASM=builtin is set, it tries to run a literal "builtin" command instead of
using the builtin assembler. This causes musl's .s files (crti.s, crtn.s, fenv.s,
dlsym.s, tlsdesc.s) to fail assembly.

Fix: When MY_ASM=builtin is set in assemble_source_file(), read the .s file content
and pass it to the target's builtin assembler (x86::assembler::assemble). For .S files,
preprocess first using our preprocessor, then assemble with builtin.

Also fix any missing x86 assembler features needed for musl assembly files.
