Task: Fix type specifier parsing order and GNU __asm__ labels on declarations

Status: In progress

Problem:
1. Type specifiers like "long unsigned int", "int long", etc. are not parsed because
   the parser expects a fixed order (e.g., unsigned must come before long).
   This causes "expected Semicolon, got Unsigned" errors when parsing system headers.

2. GNU __asm__("name") on function/variable declarations is not handled.
   This causes "expected Semicolon, got Asm" errors when parsing stdio.h which uses
   __asm__("__isoc99_scanf") for symbol renaming.

Both issues prevent parsing of system headers (stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc.), causing
~1700+ segfaults from tests that compile but produce broken output.

Fix:
- Rewrite parse_type_specifier to collect all type specifier tokens (signed, unsigned,
  long, int, short, char, etc.) and combine them into the correct type regardless
  of order.
- Add __asm__("...") handling after declarators (skip it since we don't need symbol
  renaming for now).
- Also handle __asm__ on function declarations specifically.
