Add missing ARM NEON intrinsics to arm_neon.h to fix postgres ARM build

Missing intrinsics:
- vmaxvq_u8, vmaxvq_u32 (horizontal/across-lane maximum)
- vqsubq_u8, vqsubq_u16, vqsubq_u32 (saturating subtract)
- vceqq_u32 (element-wise equality comparison for u32)
- Other commonly needed variants

These are required by PostgreSQL's SIMD support (src/include/port/simd.h).
The build fails with "undefined symbols: vceqq_u32, vmaxvq_u8, vqsubq_u8"
on both ARM with and without MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin.
