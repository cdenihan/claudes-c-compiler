Fix CMake implicit link directory detection by emitting GCC-compatible
verbose link output (ld line with -L paths and LIBRARY_PATH=...) when
the compiler is invoked with -v during linking. This allows CMake's
find_library() to locate libraries in multiarch paths like
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/.

Target project: libharu (and any other CMake-based project that uses
find_library for system libs like libm, libz).
