Task: Commit 7 - Sema populates TypeContext

Implement the seventh step of the lowerer decomposition plan:
- Have SemanticAnalyzer build a TypeContext during its AST walk
- Extend sema to register struct/union layouts and populate ctype_cache
- Change SemaResult to contain a TypeContext
- Add debug-mode assertions that sema's TypeContext matches lowerer's

Status: IN PROGRESS
