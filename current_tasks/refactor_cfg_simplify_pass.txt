Task: Refactor cfg_simplify.rs - break up god functions, deduplicate patterns, fix O(n^2) scanning

Status: in_progress

Plan:
1. Split merge_single_pred_blocks (264 lines) into 3 focused functions
2. Extract shared helpers: predecessor counting, phi cleanup, terminator remapping
3. Pass label_to_idx to sub-passes that currently rebuild it
4. Precompute LabelAddr/asm-goto target sets to eliminate O(n^2) scanning
5. Replace magic numbers with named constants
6. Use for_each_terminator_target consistently
7. Add test helper to reduce test boilerplate
