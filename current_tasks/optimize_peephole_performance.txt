Task: Optimize peephole optimizer and pass pipeline performance
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Goal: Speed up the compiler when compiling large files like SQLite.

Profiling showed these hotspots in the peephole optimizer:
- eliminate_dead_stores: 1.78% (uses core::fmt for pattern building)
- peephole_optimize: 0.98%
- combined_local_pass: 0.94%
- LineStore::new: 0.62%
- eliminate_unused_callee_saves: calling str::contains for every callee-save * every line
- core::fmt::write: 0.76% (called from peephole passes)
- core::fmt::num: 0.62% (integer formatting in pattern building)
- str::contains: 1.56% (string search in peephole passes)

Total peephole overhead: ~4.3% of compilation time.

Plan:
1. Replace fmt::write in eliminate_dead_stores with direct string building
2. Pre-classify dest register in LineInfo to avoid repeated parsing
3. Optimize eliminate_unused_callee_saves to use pre-parsed data
4. Add reusable scratch buffers for optimization pass allocations
