Fix: reject negative array sizes at compile time

The compiler currently accepts negative array sizes (e.g., `int arr[-1]`)
without error. This is required by the C standard (constraint violation) and
is critical for autoconf-style configure scripts that use negative array sizes
as a compile-time assertion mechanism (AC_CHECK_SIZEOF).

The PostgreSQL configure script uses patterns like:
  static int test_array [1 - 2 * !(sizeof(void*) <= N)];
to detect sizeof types at cross-compile time. Since we accept negative sizes,
all tests "pass" and all sizes are detected as 0, breaking the build.

Fix: Add validation in sema to reject non-VLA arrays with negative sizes.

Status: in_progress
