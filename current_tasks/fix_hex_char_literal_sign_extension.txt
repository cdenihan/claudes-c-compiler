Task: Fix hex character literal sign extension
Status: in_progress

Problem:
Character constants with hex escapes like '\xEF' are evaluated as unsigned values
(e.g., 239) instead of being sign-extended to match signed char behavior (e.g., -17).

This causes comparisons like `char c = '\xEF'; c == '\xEF'` to fail because:
- c is promoted to int as -17 (sign-extended from signed char)
- '\xEF' is evaluated as 239 (not sign-extended)

GCC treats '\xEF' as the signed char value -17 promoted to int, giving -17.
Our compiler treats it as the unsigned value 239.

Impact: Breaks BOM detection in parson JSON library and any code that uses
hex escape character literals for values > 0x7F.

Fix: In the lexer or constant evaluation, when a char constant has a hex escape
value > 0x7F and char is signed, sign-extend the value from 8 bits to int.
