Bug: Post-increment on unsigned int widens to 64-bit before incrementing

When `(unsigned long)ui++` is used where `ui` is an `unsigned int`, the post-increment
add operation is performed in 64-bit (the cast type) instead of 32-bit (the original type).
This means 0xFFFFFFFF + 1 = 0x100000000 instead of wrapping to 0.

The fix needs to be in the IR lowering for PostIncrement/PostDecrement expressions,
ensuring the increment is done in the original variable's type, not the widened type.

Failing test: wacc_chapter_12_valid_extra_credit_postfix_precedence (all architectures)
