Fix x86 dead register move elimination defense-in-depth + ParamRef slot-reuse optimization

- Add defense-in-depth check in eliminate_dead_reg_moves: after is_read_modify_write returns false,
  also check if the dest register appears in the source/address part of the instruction. Catches
  any instruction pattern where the dest reg is used as a base/index in the source operand.
- Fix emit_param_ref_impl: skip redundant load+store when dest and alloca share the same stack slot.
  Previously emitted `movq -16(%rbp), %rax; movq %rax, -16(%rbp)` which is a no-op.
- Add regression test for the LEA dead-move elimination pattern.

Status: in_progress
