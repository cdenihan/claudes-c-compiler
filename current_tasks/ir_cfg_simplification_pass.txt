Task: IR CFG Simplification Pass
Status: In Progress

Add a new IR optimization pass that simplifies the control flow graph:
1. Dead block elimination - remove blocks with no predecessors (except entry)
2. Empty block elimination - redirect through blocks that only contain Branch(target)
3. Redundant CondBranch simplification - convert CondBranch where both targets are the same to Branch
4. Jump chain threading - collapse A->B->C to A->C

This will be added to the pass pipeline in passes/mod.rs and will handle
phi node updates when redirecting edges.

Impact: Every function generates empty/dead blocks from if/else, loops,
break/continue/goto/return. Each dead IR block generates wasted assembly
instructions. This is especially impactful since the backend is stack-based.
