Task: Add constant reassociation and missing algebraic patterns to simplify pass
Status: in_progress

Description:
Add constant reassociation to the simplify pass to fold chains of operations
with multiple constants into single operations. Also add missing algebraic
identity patterns.

Changes:
1. Add BinOpDef tracking infrastructure to simplify_function
2. Constant reassociation: (x + C1) + C2 => x + (C1+C2) for Add, Sub, Shl, And, Or, Xor
3. Missing patterns: x & all_ones => x, x | all_ones => all_ones
4. Select with constant condition simplification
5. Multiply strength reduction: x*3 => x+(x<<1), x*5 => x+(x<<2), etc.

This is an IR-level optimization that benefits all backends.
