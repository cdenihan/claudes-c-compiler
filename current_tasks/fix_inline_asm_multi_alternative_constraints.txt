Fix inline asm multi-alternative constraint handling

Problem:
- x86 inline asm constraints like "Ir", "ri", "rm", "qm" are multi-alternative
  (GCC allows multiple constraint letters meaning "try first, fall back to second")
- Currently classify_constraint treats these as catch-all GpReg
- The IR lowering only checks for exact "I"/"i"/"n" matches, so "Ir" isn't
  recognized as having an immediate component
- Result: operands that should be immediates ($0) get allocated registers,
  and the register sizes don't match instruction suffixes (e.g., %rdx with btcl)

Fix:
1. IR lowering: detect "I"/"i"/"n" within multi-character constraints, try const eval
2. x86 classify_constraint: parse multi-character alternatives properly
3. Both: prefer Immediate when the constraint allows it and value is constant

Tests affected: asm-btc, asm-bts, asm-bsf-constraint, asm-cmovz, and several others
