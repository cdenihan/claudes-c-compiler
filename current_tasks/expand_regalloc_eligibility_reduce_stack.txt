Task: Expand register allocation eligibility to reduce stack frame sizes
Status: completed

Problem: Kernel functions like get_page_from_freelist (mm/page_alloc.c) and
get_partial_node (mm/slub.c) have stack frames 15-38x larger than GCC,
causing boot failures due to stack overflow. A key contributor is that
Select, GlobalAddr, LabelAddr, AtomicLoad, AtomicRmw, and AtomicCmpxchg
instructions are NOT in the register allocator's eligibility whitelist,
even though they all store results through the standard accumulator path
(store_rax_to/store_t0_to). Every such value gets an 8-byte stack slot
instead of potentially being held in a register.

Solution:
1. Added Select, GlobalAddr, LabelAddr, AtomicLoad, AtomicRmw, AtomicCmpxchg
   to the eligible instruction whitelist in regalloc.rs
2. Fixed inline asm alloca escape analysis in stack_layout.rs: allocas used
   as inline asm inputs/outputs are now marked as escaped to prevent their
   stack slots from being coalesced with block-local temporaries

Results: x86 test suite 2967/2990 (99.2%, +4 net improvement). All 36
projects pass on all architectures.
