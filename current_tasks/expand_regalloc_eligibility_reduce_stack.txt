Task: Expand register allocation eligibility to reduce stack frame sizes
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: Kernel functions like get_page_from_freelist (mm/page_alloc.c) and
get_partial_node (mm/slub.c) have stack frames 15-38x larger than GCC,
causing boot failures due to stack overflow. A key contributor is that
Select, GlobalAddr, LabelAddr, AtomicLoad, AtomicRmw, and AtomicCmpxchg
instructions are NOT in the register allocator's eligibility whitelist,
even though they all store results through the standard accumulator path
(store_rax_to/store_t0_to). Every such value gets an 8-byte stack slot
instead of potentially being held in a register.

Approach:
1. Add Select, GlobalAddr, LabelAddr, AtomicLoad, AtomicRmw, AtomicCmpxchg
   to the eligible instruction whitelist in regalloc.rs
2. Fix Tier 2 interval packing adjacency check (< to <=) in stack_layout.rs
   to allow values with adjacent non-overlapping lifetimes to share slots

This is complementary to (but distinct from):
- reduce_stack_frame_size (4-byte slots for i32)
- fix_slub_stack_overflow_immediate_consumer (skip slots for immediate consumers)
