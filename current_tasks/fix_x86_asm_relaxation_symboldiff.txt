Fix x86/i686 assembler: jump relaxation symbol values, SymbolDiff relocations, SymbolPlusOffset displacement

Three bugs being fixed:
1. Jump relaxation was not updating symbol values/sizes after shrinking code
2. SymbolDiff (.long a - b) cross-section relocations had wrong addends
3. symbol+offset memory displacements were not parsed/encoded correctly

This improves MY_ASM=builtin x86 pass rate from ~44% to ~86%.
