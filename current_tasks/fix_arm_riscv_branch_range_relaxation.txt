Fix ARM and RISC-V conditional branch range overflow for large functions.

Problem:
- ARM backend emits b.cond (b.eq, b.ne, etc.) which has +/-1MB range limit.
  For large functions like oniguruma's match_at (used by jq), conditional branches
  exceed this range and the assembler rejects them.
- RISC-V backend emits conditional branches (beq/bne/blt/bge/etc.) which have
  +/-4KB range, and uses `j` (not `jump`) in emit_fused_cmp_branch which has
  +/-1MB range. The linker truncates the JAL relocation.

Solution:
- ARM: Relax b.cond to inverted-b.cond + unconditional b (128MB range).
  e.g., "b.eq target" becomes "b.ne .Lskip ; b target ; .Lskip:"
- RISC-V: Relax conditional branches similarly, and change `j` to `jump` in
  emit_fused_cmp_branch.
- Also relax cbnz/cbz on ARM.

This fixes jq build failure on ARM and RISC-V.
