Fix i686 linker: local (STB_LOCAL) symbols incorrectly inserted into global_symbols HashMap.

Bug: In resolve_symbols(), STB_LOCAL symbols are added to the global_symbols map,
causing them to shadow global symbols with the same name from other object files.
This breaks programs where a static variable has the same name as a global variable
in another translation unit.

Fix: Skip STB_LOCAL symbols in the first pass of resolve_symbols(), matching the
behavior of linker_common::register_symbols_elf64 which correctly filters them.

Also fix start-stop-section-symbols on i686 and RISC-V if related.
