Task: Fix i686 builtin assembler to pass zlib tests
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-02-04

Problem: MY_ASM=builtin python3 /verify/verify_zlib.py --compiler ccc-i686
crashes with SIGSEGV. Without MY_ASM=builtin it works fine.

Plan: Debug the segfault, find encoding/relocation/ELF issues in the
i686 builtin assembler, and fix them.
