Task: Fix global struct identifier lowering (return address not value)

Problem:
- lower_identifier for global struct variables was loading the struct value
  instead of returning the address
- This caused memcpy in struct assignment to use the struct VALUE as a
  source ADDRESS, leading to segfaults
- Fix: return GlobalAddr for global structs (matching local struct behavior)

Result: +15 passing tests, ~15 fewer segfaults
