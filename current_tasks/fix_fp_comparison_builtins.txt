Fix __builtin_isunordered and __builtin_islessgreater FP comparison builtins

Problem:
__builtin_isunordered(a, b) always returns 1 regardless of inputs.
  It should return 1 only when either argument is NaN.
  Current implementation uses IrCmpOp::Ne which is wrong - it just checks a != b.

__builtin_islessgreater(nan, 3.14) returns 1 instead of 0.
  It should return (a < b) || (a > b), which is false when either is NaN.
  Current implementation uses IrCmpOp::Ne which doesn't handle NaN correctly.

Also: __builtin_classify_type returns integer_type_class (1) for function types
  instead of pointer_type_class (5).

Root cause: In expr_builtins.rs, FpCompare uses inappropriate IrCmpOp values
for isunordered and islessgreater.

Fix plan:
1. __builtin_isunordered: emit (a != a) || (b != b) to check NaN-ness
2. __builtin_islessgreater: emit (a < b) || (a > b) as two comparisons + OR
3. classify_ctype: map Function types to pointer_type_class (5)
4. Add regression tests
