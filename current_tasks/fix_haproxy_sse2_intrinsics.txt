Task: Add missing SSE2 intrinsics for haproxy (xxhash)

haproxy uses xxhash which requires _mm_mul_epu32 (PMULUDQ) and _mm_set_epi64x
intrinsics that are not yet implemented in our emmintrin.h.

Plan:
- Add _mm_set_epi64x as pure C inline (set two 64-bit values)
- Add _mm_mul_epu32 as pure C inline (unsigned 32x32->64 multiply)
- Add regression test
- Verify haproxy builds and passes on all architectures
