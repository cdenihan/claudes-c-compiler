Task: Fix mem2reg incorrectly promoting array allocas whose address escapes via Store val

Status: In progress

Problem:
mem2reg was promoting small array allocas (size <= 8 bytes) to SSA even when their
address was used as the value operand of a Store instruction (array-to-pointer decay).
This caused NULL to be generated instead of the array's stack address when code like
`Y.p = local_array;` was compiled.

Root cause: The Store instruction match in find_promotable_allocas only checked the
`ptr` field for candidate tracking, but not the `val` field for disqualification.
The `instruction_used_values` function also skipped Store entirely, so the val operand
was invisible to the disqualification logic.

Fix:
1. In find_promotable_allocas: check Store.val for alloca references and disqualify them
2. In instruction_used_values: track Store.val operand

This fixes the mbedtls selftest crash (SIGSEGV in mbedtls_mpi_cmp_mpi called from
mbedtls_mpi_cmp_int which uses the pattern: `uint_t p[1]; Y.p = p;`)
