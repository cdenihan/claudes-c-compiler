Problem:
IPCP dead call elimination incorrectly removes calls to functions that contain
Terminator::Unreachable (i.e., functions containing __builtin_trap()). The
find_dead_call_functions() function classifies such functions as side-effect-free
because:
1. is_side_effect_free() only checks instructions, not terminators
2. The all_void_returns check uses `_ => true` which matches Unreachable

This causes __builtin_trap() calls to be silently eliminated when the trap
is inside a separate function that gets called. The ud2 instruction disappears
and the program continues executing past where it should have trapped.

Fix:
In find_dead_call_functions(), explicitly check for Unreachable terminators
and exclude functions containing them from dead call elimination. Unreachable
terminators represent observable side effects (program crash via ud2/brk/ebreak).
