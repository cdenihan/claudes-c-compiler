Task: Clean up debug artifacts and improve panic/error messages

Status: in_progress

Goal: Fix several Rust style issues that would make experienced Rust developers
cringe:
1. Remove hardcoded "write16" debug filter in inline pass (leftover debugging)
2. Add messages to all bare unreachable!() calls (11 instances)
3. Fix silent exit on thread panic in main.rs (no error message printed)
4. Add program name prefix to top-level error output (Unix convention)
5. Convert key bare .unwrap() calls to .expect() with descriptive messages

Approach: Style-only changes. No functional changes. No behavior changes except
better error/panic messages when things go wrong.
