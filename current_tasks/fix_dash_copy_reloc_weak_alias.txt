Fix x86 linker COPY relocation for weak alias symbols (e.g. environ -> __environ)

When the linker creates a COPY relocation for a symbol that is a WEAK alias
in a shared library (like `environ` which is a weak alias for `__environ` in libc),
we need to also emit the canonical GLOBAL name in the dynamic symbol table.
Otherwise, the shared library's internal references to the GLOBAL name won't
be redirected to our BSS copy, causing NULL pointer crashes.

Test case: dash shell (uses `environ` which is weak alias of `__environ` in glibc)
