Fix: peephole copy propagation doesn't recognize single-operand shift/rotate
instructions (shrq %reg, shlq %reg, etc.) as modifying their destination register.

This causes the copy propagation pass to incorrectly replace the register
in store instructions after inline asm shift operations, storing the original
unshifted value instead of the shift result.

Bug manifests when inline asm with "shrq %0" (no immediate) is used in a loop
context where inlining creates multiple inline asm blocks in the same function.
