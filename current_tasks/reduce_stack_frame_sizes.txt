Reduce stack frame sizes for postgres plpgsql stack depth fix

Problem: PostgreSQL plpgsql tests fail with "stack depth limit exceeded"
because CCC generates stack frames 2.5-4x larger than GCC for key recursive
functions in the PL/pgSQL execution path.

Root causes:
1. Tier 2 liveness-based stack packing threshold too high (>=8 blocks && >=64 insts)
   Many postgres functions have 3-7 blocks with many multi-block intermediates
   that each get their own permanent 8-byte stack slot instead of being packed.
2. Dead values (defined but never read) still get stack slots allocated.
3. Call results always get stack slots even when only used once immediately after.

Fix plan:
- Lower Tier 2 threshold to enable liveness packing for smaller functions
- Add dead value elimination to skip stack slots for values never read
- These are safe, architecture-independent changes in generation.rs

Status: in_progress
