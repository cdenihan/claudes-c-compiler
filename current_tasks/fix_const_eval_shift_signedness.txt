Fix compile-time constant evaluation for right-shift to use correct signedness.

Bug: The const evaluators (sema/const_eval.rs and ir/lowering/const_eval.rs) use
"usual arithmetic conversions" to determine the is_unsigned flag for ALL binary
operations, including shifts. But C11 6.5.7 says shift result type is determined
only by the left operand's promoted type. This causes unsigned right-shifts to
become arithmetic shifts when the RHS has different signedness/size.

Also: parser/declarations.rs eval_const_int_expr always uses i64::wrapping_shr
(arithmetic shift) with no unsigned tracking at all.

Fix: For shift operations, derive is_unsigned from only the LHS type.

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0000_0124, 0126, 0129, 0134, 0136, 0139, 0146,
0159, 0161, 0164, 0169, 0171 and others with right-shift tag.
