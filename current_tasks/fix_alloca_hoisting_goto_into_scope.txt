Fix: Hoist alloca instructions to function entry block

Problem: When a goto jumps into a block scope, variables declared in that scope
have their alloca instructions emitted into an unreachable basic block. The CFG
simplification pass removes dead blocks, destroying these allocas. Subsequent
stores/loads to those variables reference Values with no stack slot, producing
garbage values at runtime.

Example:
  goto inner;
  {
      int b;        // alloca emitted in dead block
  inner:
      b = 1234;     // stores to destroyed alloca -> garbage
      printf("b = %d\n", b);  // prints garbage
  }

Fix: Hoist all alloca instructions to the function's entry block during lowering,
which is standard practice for SSA-based compilers (same as LLVM). This ensures
allocas are always reachable and also makes them eligible for mem2reg promotion.

Affected tests:
- tcc_54_goto (goto into block scope)
- Potentially other tests involving goto/switch jumping past declarations

Files to modify:
- src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs (emit allocas into entry block)
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs (helper to emit into entry block)
