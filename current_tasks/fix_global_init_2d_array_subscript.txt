Fix global initializer constant evaluation for multi-dimensional array element addresses.

Bug: `int a[6][9]; int *c = &a[3][5];` results in c being NULL.
Root cause: eval_global_addr_expr only handles single-level ArraySubscript
where base is directly an Identifier. Chained subscripts like a[3][5]
produce nested ArraySubscript AST nodes which weren't handled.

Fix: Added resolve_chained_array_subscript() that recursively walks
nested ArraySubscript nodes, accumulating byte offsets using
array_dim_strides.
