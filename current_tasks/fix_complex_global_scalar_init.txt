Task: Fix _Complex global variable initialization from scalar values
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: When a global _Complex float/double variable is initialized with a
scalar (non-complex) value, e.g. `_Complex float g = 1.0f;`, the variable
ends up initialized to zero instead of the correct value (1.0 + 0.0i).

The bug only occurs with scalar initializers. Complex initializers like
`_Complex float g = 1.0f + 2.0f * I;` work correctly.

Impact: This breaks the compiler_suite_0109_0090 test (complex float
multiplication loop using a global accumulator initialized with 1.0f),
and likely affects other complex number tests.

Fix: Locate the global variable initializer emission code and ensure that
scalar-to-complex conversion is handled when emitting initial data bytes.
