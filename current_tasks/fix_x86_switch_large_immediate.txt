Task: Fix x86 switch statement with large case values (> signed 32-bit)
Status: in_progress

Problem: emit_switch_case_branch() emits `cmpq $case_val, %rax` directly without
checking if case_val fits in a signed 32-bit immediate. On x86-64, `cmpq` only
accepts sign-extended 32-bit immediates. Values >= 2^31 (e.g., ioctl constants
like 0x80041272) cause assembler errors: "operand type mismatch for `cmp'".

Also affects emit_switch_jump_table() which has the same issue for subq and cmpq
with min_val and range values that exceed the immediate range.

Failing kernel files: block/ioctl.c, security/selinux/hooks.c, and others with
large switch case values (common in ioctl dispatch code).

Fix: When the immediate doesn't fit in signed 32-bit, load it into %rcx first
via movabsq, then use register-register cmpq.
