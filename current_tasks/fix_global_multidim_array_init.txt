Fix global multi-dimensional array initialization element stride

Bug: Global multi-dimensional arrays (2D, 3D, etc.) write initializer
elements at pointer-sized (8-byte) offsets instead of the actual element
type size. For example, int g[2][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}} writes values
at 8-byte intervals instead of 4-byte, causing data corruption and
loss of later sub-arrays.

Local multi-dimensional array init works correctly; only global init
is affected. The root cause is in the global initializer emission code
which uses the wrong stride when walking nested array elements.

Status: LOCKED
