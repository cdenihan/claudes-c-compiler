Task: Fix miscompilation of kernel/rcu/tree.c causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

The kernel file kernel/rcu/tree.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing boot failure
when this single file is compiled with ccc instead of gcc. This file implements
the RCU (Read-Copy-Update) tree hierarchy for the Linux kernel.

Plan:
1. Compare ccc vs gcc assembly output for tree.c
2. Identify which function(s) are miscompiled
3. Create a minimal test case reproducing the bug
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with --test-one-file
6. Add regression test
