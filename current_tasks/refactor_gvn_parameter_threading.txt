Refactor: GVN pass parameter threading -> GvnState struct

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The GVN pass (src/passes/gvn.rs) threads 10-14 separate &mut parameters
through its recursive DFS functions (gvn_dfs has 14 params, process_block
has 10 params). This violates Rust conventions and results in duplicated
state initialization code between run_gvn_with_analysis and
run_gvn_single_block.

Fix:
- Introduce a GvnState struct that groups all the mutable GVN state
  (value_numbers, next_vn, expr_to_value, load_expr_to_value,
   load_generation, rollback_log, load_rollback_log, vn_log, total_eliminated)
- Convert gvn_dfs and process_block to take &mut GvnState instead of
  10+ individual &mut parameters
- Eliminate the duplicated state initialization in run_gvn_single_block
  and run_gvn_with_analysis by using GvnState::new()
- Also refactor operand_to_vn and make_expr_key to use the state struct
