Implement GCC-style driver flags: -D, -S, -c, -E

These are fundamental compiler driver modes:
- -D<name>=<value>: Define preprocessor macro (passed to preprocessor)
- -S: Compile to assembly only (output .s file)
- -c: Compile to object file only (don't link)
- -E: Preprocess only (output preprocessed source)

Plan:
1. Parse -D flags in main.rs, store defines in Driver
2. Pass defines to Preprocessor which pre-seeds them as macros
3. Implement -S mode: run through codegen, write .s file, skip assemble+link
4. Implement -c mode: run through assemble, skip linking
5. Implement -E mode: preprocess only, print to stdout
