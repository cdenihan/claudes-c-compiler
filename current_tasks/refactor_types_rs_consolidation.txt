Task: Refactor types.rs - consolidate duplicated type resolution and split into modules
Status: Completed

Problem:
types.rs was 2591 lines with three major functions (get_expr_type, sizeof_expr, get_expr_ctype)
that all traverse the same AST with nearly identical match structures. eval_const_binop had
heavily repeated is_32bit/is_unsigned branching patterns.

Solution:
Split types.rs into three focused modules:
- const_eval.rs (768 lines): compile-time constant evaluation
  - eval_const_expr, eval_const_binop (simplified with wrap_result/unsigned_op/bool_to_i64 helpers)
  - eval_global_addr_expr, resolve_to_global_name, expr_as_array_size
- expr_types.rs (911 lines): expression type resolution
  - get_expr_type (broken into get_binop_type, get_subscript_type, get_call_return_type)
  - sizeof_expr (broken into sizeof_identifier, sizeof_deref, sizeof_subscript, sizeof_member_access, sizeof_binop)
  - get_expr_ctype (broken into get_binop_ctype, get_field_ctype)
- types.rs (999 lines): core type conversion/resolution utilities

Zero test regressions (91/100 pass, same 9 pre-existing failures).
