Add big WARNING messages when MY_ASM/MY_LD are not set and the compiler
falls back to calling GCC-backed assembler or linker.

The warnings should be loud and obvious so developers immediately notice
when they're not using the builtin assembler/linker.

Files to modify:
- src/backend/common.rs (assemble_with_extra, link_with_args GCC paths)
- src/driver/external_tools.rs (assemble_source_file GCC path)
