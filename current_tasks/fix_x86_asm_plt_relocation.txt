Fix x86 assembler: jmp and jcc instructions should strip @PLT suffix from labels
and emit R_X86_64_PLT32 relocations instead of R_X86_64_PC32.

Also fix linker to handle any remaining @PLT-suffixed symbols from object files.

This is needed for Redis to build, since hiredis is compiled with -fPIC and
our codegen emits `jmp foo@PLT` for tail calls.
