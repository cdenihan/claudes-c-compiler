Task: Inline empty static void functions to eliminate dead references
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

Problem: When CONFIG_FINEIBT is not defined, the kernel provides an empty stub:
  static void __apply_fineibt(...) { }
This is called in alternative_instructions() with __cfi_sites/__cfi_sites_end as
arguments. GCC inlines the empty function and DCE removes the argument references.
CCC does not inline the empty function (it requires both `static` AND `inline`),
so the call and its undefined symbol references remain, causing a link error:
  undefined reference to `__cfi_sites`
  undefined reference to `__cfi_sites_end`

Fix: Extend the inlining pass to also inline static functions that are trivially
empty (single block, zero instructions, void return). This doesn't require the
`inline` keyword since the function is effectively a no-op. After inlining, DCE
and CFG simplification will clean up the dead argument computation.
