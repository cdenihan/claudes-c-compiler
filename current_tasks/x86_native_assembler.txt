Task: Implement native x86-64 assembler scaffold

Goal: Write a built-in x86-64 assembler that can parse .s files generated by the
x86 backend and produce ELF .o object files, replacing the need for gcc as an
external assembler.

This includes:
- Parser for x86-64 assembly (.s format as emitted by our codegen)
- x86-64 instruction encoder (ModRM/SIB/REX encoding)
- ELF object file writer with proper relocations
- Integration via MY_ASM environment variable
- scripts/compare_asm.py for comparing output with GCC assembler

Status: in progress
