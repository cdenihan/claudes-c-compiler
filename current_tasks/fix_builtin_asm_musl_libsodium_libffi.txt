Fix builtin assembler issues blocking musl, libsodium, and libffi:

x86:
- fnstsw %ax instruction support (musl)
- vblendps AVX instruction (libsodium)
- .size directive expression support with `. - symbol` (libffi)

Also fix libsodium memset_s parsing issue.

Working on getting these projects building with MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin.
