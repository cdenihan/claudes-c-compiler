Task: Fix static function linkage, unsigned type coercion, and _Static_assert
Status: IN PROGRESS

Fixes:
1. Static function linkage: Function definitions inherit internal linkage
   from prior static declarations of the same name (C99 6.2.2p5).
2. Unsigned-to-float coercion: Fix static initializer to use u64->f64
   conversion for unsigned source types, not i64->f64 which produces
   negative values for large unsigned values.
3. Float-to-unsigned coercion: Fix coerce_to() to use f64->u32->i32 etc.
   instead of f64->i32 which saturates for values > i32::MAX.
4. _Static_assert: Skip at both file scope and block scope in parser.
