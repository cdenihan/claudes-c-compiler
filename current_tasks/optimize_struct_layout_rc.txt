Optimize: Eliminate StructLayout deep cloning via Rc<StructLayout>

TASK:
Replace StructLayout with Rc<StructLayout> throughout the lowering code to eliminate
expensive deep clones. Currently every struct member access, variable declaration,
and pointer-to-struct dereference clones the entire StructLayout including all
field names (String), field types (CType), and offsets.

SCOPE:
- Change TypeContext::struct_layouts to store Rc<StructLayout>
- Change VarInfo::struct_layout to Option<Rc<StructLayout>>
- Update all call sites that currently clone StructLayout to use Rc::clone instead
- Also add a field name -> index HashMap for O(1) field lookup on large structs

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- Save 30-50ms on sqlite3.c lowering (from ~0.35s to ~0.30s)
- Reduces heap allocation pressure from malloc/free overhead (7-8% of total profile)
