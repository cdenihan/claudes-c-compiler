Fix vector element stride for struct/union member vector subscript

Bug: When accessing elements of a vector type that is a struct/union member
(e.g., s.a[3] where a is float __attribute__((vector_size(16)))), the element
stride is computed as pointer size (8 bytes on x86-64) instead of the actual
element size (4 bytes for float). This causes out-of-bounds memory access.

Root cause: get_member_array_elem_size() in lvalue.rs handles CType::Array
and CType::Pointer but not CType::Vector. When the field type is Vector,
it returns None, causing fallback to target_ptr_size() (8).

Fix: Add CType::Vector(elem_ty, _) case to get_member_array_elem_size()
that returns the vector element size.

Also needs the same fix in get_array_elem_size() legacy fallback and
get_subscript_type() MemberAccess fallback.

Affects: gifsicle (segfault on resize), likely other projects using SIMD vectors.
Status: in_progress
