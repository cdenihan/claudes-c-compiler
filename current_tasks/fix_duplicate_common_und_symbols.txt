Fix: Deduplicate COMMON and UND symbol entries in x86 ELF object writer

When a symbol is declared with .comm (COMMON) and also referenced in code,
it appears twice in the symbol table: once as UND (from relocation scan)
and once as COMMON (from post-append). The linker then sees the UND entry
first and fails with "undefined symbol".

Fix: When appending COMMON symbols, remove any duplicate UND entry for the
same symbol name from the shared_symbols list.

This fixes the attribute-common-multi-tu test and is needed for Redis's
redismodule.h pattern.
