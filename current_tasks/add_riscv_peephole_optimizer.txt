Task: Add peephole optimizer for RISC-V backend
Status: in_progress
Description: The RISC-V backend has no peephole optimization, while x86 has a mature
3300-line peephole optimizer. Adding peephole passes to RISC-V will improve code quality
significantly. Starting with the highest-impact optimizations:
1. Adjacent store/load elimination (sd/ld at same s0 offset)
2. Redundant jump elimination (jump to next label)
3. Self-move elimination (mv t0, t0)
4. Dead store elimination
