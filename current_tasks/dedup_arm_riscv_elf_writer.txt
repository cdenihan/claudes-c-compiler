Deduplicate ARM and RISC-V ELF writer shared infrastructure.

The ARM and RISC-V assembler ELF writers (arm/assembler/elf_writer.rs and
riscv/assembler/elf_writer.rs) have structurally identical types (Section,
ElfReloc, ElfSymbol) and many duplicated methods (ensure_section, current_offset,
emit_bytes, emit_u32_le, add_reloc, align_to, write_elf, process_directive for
.global/.weak/.hidden/.type/.size/.align/.byte/.short/.long/.quad/.comm/.local/.set).

This task extracts the shared types and methods into the shared elf.rs module,
reducing ~500+ lines of duplication while keeping architecture-specific logic
(instruction encoding, branch resolution, compression) in the per-arch files.
