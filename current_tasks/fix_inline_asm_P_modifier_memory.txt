Fix: inline asm %P modifier with memory operands

The %P modifier in x86 inline asm was not handling memory operands.
When %P was used with a memory-constrained operand (e.g., "=m"(*addr)),
the modifier would fall through to the register case and emit just the
register name without %, producing broken assembly like "movl %ecx, "
instead of "movl %ecx, -80(%rbp)".

This caused COMPILE_FAIL for kernel files using alternative_io() with
%P memory operands, such as arch/x86/kernel/irq_work.c.
