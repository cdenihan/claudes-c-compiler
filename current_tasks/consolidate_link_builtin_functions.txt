Consolidate 5 near-identical link_builtin_* functions in common.rs into a single generic function.

The functions link_builtin_x86, link_builtin_i686, link_builtin_aarch64, link_builtin_riscv,
and link_builtin_riscv_shared duplicate ~210 lines with only minor variations:
- Which DirectLdArchConfig constant to use
- Which extra libraries to add (gcc_eh/gcc_s)
- Whether shared library output is supported
- Slight API differences in per-arch linker::link_builtin signatures

Also:
- Replace magic ELF machine numbers (62, 243, 183, 3) with named constants from elf.rs
- Clean up link_with_args dispatch to be less verbose
- Remove unnecessary #[allow(dead_code)] where possible
