RISC-V Peephole: Full BB Copy Propagation, Dead Register Move Elimination, Branch-over-Branch

Enhance the RISC-V peephole optimizer with three new optimizations ported from the x86 backend:

1. Full basic-block copy propagation: Replace the current single-instruction
   lookahead with a copy map that tracks register copies across entire basic
   blocks, with transitive chain resolution.

2. Dead register move elimination: After copy propagation, scan forward from
   each `mv` instruction to determine if the destination register is overwritten
   before being read. If so, the move is dead and can be eliminated.

3. Branch-over-branch optimization: Transform `bCC rs1, rs2, .Lskip / j .target / .Lskip:`
   into `b!CC rs1, rs2, .target`, eliminating one instruction.

These are proven optimizations from the x86 backend that will reduce code size
and eliminate unnecessary instructions in the RISC-V kernel build.
