Task: Fix struct return for structs > 8 bytes using sret (struct return pointer)

Problem: Structs > 8 bytes returned from functions produce garbage values (0.0, wrong data)
because the callee returns a pointer to its own stack alloca, which is invalid after return.

Fix: Implement the sret calling convention:
1. Caller allocates space for result struct, passes hidden first pointer arg
2. Callee receives sret pointer, memcpys result to it before returning
3. All three architectures affected (x86, ARM, RISC-V) since bug is in IR lowering

This affects hundreds of tests producing wrong output.
