Fix RISC-V builtin assembler register-vs-symbol disambiguation

The assembler parser's parse_single_operand function unconditionally checks
is_register() before falling through to the symbol case. This causes function
and variable names that match register names (e.g., f1, a0, ra, s1, s2) to
be misinterpreted as registers in instructions like call, tail, la, and lla.

Fix: Make the parser context-aware so that operand positions that expect
symbols (like the target of call/tail, or the second operand of la/lla)
are parsed as symbols, not registers.
