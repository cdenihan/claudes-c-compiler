Task: Fix label attribute parsing (e.g., `done: __attribute__((unused));`)

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The parser does not handle GCC label attributes, where __attribute__ follows a label.
For example: `done: __attribute__((__unused__));`
This is a valid GNU C extension used in the Linux kernel (e.g., kernel/sched/fair.c).

The parser sees `__attribute__` after the label colon and tries to parse it as an
expression statement, failing with "unexpected token Attribute in expression".

Fix:
After parsing a label in the statement parser, check if the next token is __attribute__
and if so, skip the attribute (label attributes like unused are just hints to suppress
warnings and don't affect code generation).

Files affected:
- src/frontend/parser/parser.rs or statements.rs (label parsing)
- kernel/sched/fair.c (currently fails to compile due to this)
