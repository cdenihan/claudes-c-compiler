Goal: Fix several inconsistencies between x86, ARM, and RISC-V backends that were
identified by systematic comparison of the three codegen implementations.

Fixes:
1. Missing cg.set_pic(opts.pic) in generate_assembly_with_opts_and_debug for ARM and RISC-V.
   When debug info is requested (-g), PIC mode is silently ignored on these backends.

2. Missing emit_label_addr override on ARM and RISC-V. Labels (from computed gotos)
   are always local, but without an override they fall through to emit_global_addr
   which may use GOT indirection in PIC mode (unnecessary overhead).

3. Missing emit_return override on RISC-V for F128 (long double). The default path
   loads an f64 approximation and extends via __extenddftf2, losing precision.
   RISC-V already has emit_f128_operand_to_a0_a1 which preserves full precision.
