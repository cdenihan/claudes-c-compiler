Fix __builtin_offsetof constant folding in IR lowering

Bug: __builtin_offsetof(type, member) expands to ((unsigned long)&((type*)0)->member)
but lower_address_of() was not recognizing the &((type*)0)->member pattern for constant
folding. The offsetof value was computed at runtime (xor+lea) instead of being folded
to a compile-time constant integer.

This caused BUILD_BUG_ON(offsetof(...) != N) in the Linux kernel to leave undefined
references to __compiletime_assert_NNN symbols, since the dead branch (if(0) call())
was not eliminated.

Fix: In lower_address_of(), try eval_offsetof_pattern() first. When the inner expression
matches the &((type*)0)->member pattern, return the constant offset directly instead of
generating runtime pointer arithmetic.
