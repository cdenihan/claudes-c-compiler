Task: Fix unnamed variadic macro last-param contamination

Bug: For unnamed variadic macros (#define FOO(a, b, ...) body), the last
named parameter (e.g., 'b') incorrectly absorbs all variadic arguments
during substitution, producing 'b, extra' instead of just 'b'.

Root cause: substitute_params() in macro_defs.rs checks
`is_variadic && idx == params.len() - 1` to detect named variadic params
(like `args...`), but this also matches the last regular param of unnamed
variadic macros (`...`). The two cases are not distinguished.

Impact: This breaks COUNT_ARGS / CONCATENATE patterns used extensively in
the Linux kernel (arch/x86/include/asm/rmwcc.h, linux/args.h), causing
66+ kernel files to fail compilation with "expected RParen, got LBracket".

Fix: Add `has_named_variadic` field to MacroDef to distinguish named
variadic (args...) from unnamed variadic (...). Only apply the
named-variadic substitution path when has_named_variadic is true.

Status: In progress
