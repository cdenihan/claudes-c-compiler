Fix compound literal pointer arithmetic in global initializers.

Problem: Global variable initializers of the form:
  var x = (type*)((char*)(compound_literal) + offset);
produce NULL instead of the correct address.

The issue is in eval_global_addr_expr() which encounters CompoundLiteral nodes
but can only look for addresses *within* the initializer (for patterns like
struct wrappers around function pointers). For bare array/struct compound
literals used as the base of pointer arithmetic, it needs to materialize
them as anonymous globals first.

Fix: Add a pre-processing step in lower_global_init_expr that materializes
compound literals embedded in arithmetic expressions as anonymous globals,
then let eval_global_addr_expr resolve the full address expression.

This fixes the cello project.
