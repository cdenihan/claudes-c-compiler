Task: fix_sizeof_unsized_array
Status: in_progress
Description: Fix sizeof() returning pointer size (8) for unsized arrays declared with [].

Bug: When an array is declared as `type arr[] = {...}`, fixup_unsized_array updates
alloc_size but not c_type, leaving it as CType::Array(elem, None). sizeof_identifier
for globals prefers c_type, and CType::Array(_, None).size_ctx() returns 8 (pointer size).

Fix: After fixup_unsized_array computes the resolved element count, also update
da.c_type from Array(elem, None) to Array(elem, Some(count)).

Impact: Fixes postgres initdb crash (pg_char_to_encoding binary search used
lengthof(pg_encname_tbl) which returned 0 due to this bug).
