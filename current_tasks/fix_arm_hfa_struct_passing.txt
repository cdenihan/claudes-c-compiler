Task: Fix ARM AArch64 ABI for Homogeneous Floating-Point Aggregate (HFA) struct parameter passing

Bug: On AArch64, structs consisting entirely of float/double members (up to 4 members
of the same FP type) are Homogeneous Floating-Point Aggregates (HFAs). Per the AArch64
PCS, these must be passed in consecutive floating-point/SIMD registers (d0-d7/s0-s7),
not in integer registers (x0-x7).

Currently, the ARM backend passes ALL structs via integer registers, which is incorrect
for HFA structs. This causes ABI incompatibility with GCC-compiled code.

Example:
  struct { double r; double i; } s = {1.0, 2.0};
  func(s);  // Should pass s.r in d0, s.i in d1
            // Currently passes s.r in x0, s.i in x1

This affects:
- Struct parameter passing (caller side)
- Struct parameter receiving (callee side)
- Struct return values (HFAs returned in d0-d3/s0-s3)
- #pragma weak alias tests (0147 series) where alias reinterprets types
- ABI compatibility with GCC-compiled object files

Status: in_progress
