Task: Fix inline asm clobber register conflicts causing execution timeouts

The inline asm scratch register allocator was not respecting clobber lists,
which could assign the same physical register to both an operand and a clobber,
causing infinite loops in asm blocks with loop+cbnz/bnez patterns.

Also handles ARM64 w/x register aliasing (wN and xN are the same physical register).

Affected tests:
- asm-cmp-branch-arm-004-run1 (ARM)
- asm-neon-sub-arm-006-run1 (ARM)
- asm-bnez-riscv-001f-run2 (RISC-V)
