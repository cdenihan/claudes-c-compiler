Fix __is_constexpr macro: non-constant expressions treated as constant

The kernel's __is_constexpr macro uses a ternary trick with null pointer constants:
  (sizeof(int) == sizeof(*(8 ? ((void *)((long)(x) * 0l)) : (int *)8)))

When x is a non-constant expression (e.g. volatile variable * 0l), our compiler
incorrectly treats the result as a null pointer constant, making __is_constexpr
return 1 instead of 0.

This causes GENMASK_INPUT_CHECK to return 4 (sizeof struct with int:0 bitfield)
instead of 0, corrupting all runtime GENMASK computations. This is the root cause
of the ARM defconfig kernel boot crash (BUG in kvm_update_va_mask) and likely
affects other architectures too.

The fix needs to be in how the compiler evaluates null pointer constant status
in conditional expressions - only ((void*)0) with a truly constant zero should
be considered a null pointer constant.
