Fix complex-to-scalar return conversion for F64/double return type

Problem: When a function returns a scalar type (e.g., double) but the return
expression is a complex type, the real part extraction was skipped for F64
return types. The guard condition `ret_ty != IrType::F64` in the return
statement lowering incorrectly excluded double returns from complex-to-scalar
conversion.

Fix: Remove the F64 exclusion from the guard in stmt.rs return handling,
so that all scalar return types (including F64) properly extract the real
part of a complex expression.

Status: In progress
