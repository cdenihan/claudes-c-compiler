Task: Fix complex return type ABI regression from lowerer refactoring
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
The compute_function_return_type() function introduced during the lowerer
decomposition refactoring did not apply complex ABI overrides when computing
the IR return type for function definitions. It returned IrType::Ptr for
complex types instead of F64 (ComplexDouble) or F32/F64 (ComplexFloat).

The register_function_meta() function (which runs in the first pass for
forward declarations) correctly applies these overrides, but
compute_function_return_type() was not using the already-registered signature.

Fix: Use the already-registered return type from func_meta.sigs in
compute_function_return_type() instead of recomputing from type_spec_to_ir.
