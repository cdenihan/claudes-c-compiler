Task: fix_asm_goto_i_constraint_dropped
Status: completed
Description:
  asm goto body is silently dropped when "i" constraints contain pointer or
  address values.  When an asm goto statement uses an "i" (immediate) input
  constraint whose operand is a pointer or address expression, the compiler
  incorrectly discards the entire asm body during code generation.  This
  causes the assembled output to contain no instructions for the asm goto
  block, leading to missing control-flow transfers and potential silent
  miscompilation.  The fix must ensure that "i" constraint operands carrying
  pointer/address values are properly materialized so the asm goto body is
  emitted as expected.
