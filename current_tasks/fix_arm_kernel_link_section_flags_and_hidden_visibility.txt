Fix two ARM kernel link failures:

1. Const globals in custom sections (.modinfo) getting wrong section flags ("aw" instead of "a")
   - The compiler was using section name heuristics (checking for "rodata") instead of the
     global's is_const flag to determine section writability
   - Fix: Use g.is_const to set read-only flags for const-qualified globals in custom sections

2. Unused hidden-visibility extern declarations creating spurious undefined symbols
   - .hidden directives for unreferenced extern symbols cause the assembler to emit undefined
     symbol entries, leading to linker errors (e.g., kernel _timens_data, __efistub_* symbols)
   - Fix: Filter symbol_attrs in DCE pass to only emit visibility directives for referenced symbols
