Task: Fix user-defined functions with builtin names being treated as builtins
Status: in_progress
Description: When a user defines a function body for a name that matches a compiler
builtin (e.g., __builtin_alloca), the compiler incorrectly uses the builtin instead
of calling the user's function. This commonly occurs when <alloca.h> macro-expands
`alloca` to `__builtin_alloca` but the user also defines `static double *alloca() { ... }`.
Fix: Check sema's is_defined flag in try_lower_builtin_call to prefer user-defined
functions over builtins.
