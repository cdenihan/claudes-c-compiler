Fix global initializer constant address expressions involving struct member access

The compiler fails to handle global pointer initializers like:
  int *ptr = &items[1].id;
  int *ptr = &((Upgrade_items + 1)->uaattrid);

The issue is in resolve_chained_member_access() in const_eval.rs:
- It doesn't handle ArraySubscript as a base of a MemberAccess chain
- eval_global_addr_expr() doesn't handle PointerMemberAccess expressions

Fix: extend resolve_chained_member_access to handle ArraySubscript base,
and add PointerMemberAccess support to eval_global_addr_expr.
