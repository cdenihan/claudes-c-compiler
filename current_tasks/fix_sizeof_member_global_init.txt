Fix: sizeof(global_var.member) crashes in global initializer context

The compiler panics with "not inside a function" when evaluating sizeof()
applied to a member access expression (e.g., sizeof(global_var.field)) in a
global initializer context. This is because get_layout_for_expr() calls
self.func() which assumes a function context exists.

Fix: In get_layout_for_expr's Identifier arm, use self.func_state.as_ref()
instead of self.func() to gracefully handle the global context case.
