Add .purgem assembler directive support to the shared asm_preprocess::expand_macros() function.

The RISC-V kernel build fails because inline assembly in arch/riscv/include/asm/insn-def.h
uses .purgem to undefine macros after use. The shared expand_macros() function in
asm_preprocess.rs does not handle .purgem, causing "unsupported RISC-V assembler directive: .purgem"
errors.

Both ARM and x86 assemblers have their own macro expansion that handles .purgem, but since
RISC-V delegates to the shared module, we need to add .purgem support there.
