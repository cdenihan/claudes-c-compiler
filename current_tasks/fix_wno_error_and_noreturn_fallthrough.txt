Task: Fix -Wno-error flag handling and noreturn fall-through analysis
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
1. The -Wno-error flag (without =name) is silently ignored by WarningConfig::process_flag(),
   meaning -Werror cannot be disabled. This breaks projects like http-parser that use
   -Werror in their Makefile and -Wno-error in extra flags.
2. The sema fall-through analysis does not recognize calls to noreturn functions
   (abort(), exit(), etc.) as non-returning, causing false -Wreturn-type warnings.

Fix:
1. Add "no-error" case to process_flag() that sets werror_all = false
2. Enhance stmt_can_fall_through() to detect expression statements that are
   calls to noreturn functions
