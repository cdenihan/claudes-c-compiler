Task: Fix __builtin_constant_p returning 1 for local variables
Status: in_progress

Problem:
__builtin_constant_p(x) where x is a local variable (int x = 10) incorrectly
returns 1 instead of 0. This happens because after mem2reg promotes the variable
to SSA, the constant fold pass sees the variable's constant value through the
const_map and resolves IsConstant to 1.

GCC semantics: __builtin_constant_p(variable) should return 0, even if the
variable's value is known at compile time. It should only return 1 for:
- Literal constants (42, 'a', etc.)
- Constant expressions (1 + 2, sizeof(int))
- After inlining, if a parameter became a constant

Fix:
Add is_inline_candidate flag to FunctionBuildState. In non-inline functions,
resolve __builtin_constant_p immediately to 0 at lowering time when the
expression is not a compile-time constant. In inline-candidate functions,
emit the IsConstant IR instruction for post-inline resolution.

Files affected:
- src/ir/lowering/func_state.rs (add is_inline_candidate field)
- src/ir/lowering/func_lowering.rs (set the field)
- src/ir/lowering/expr_builtins.rs (check the field in ConstantP handling)
