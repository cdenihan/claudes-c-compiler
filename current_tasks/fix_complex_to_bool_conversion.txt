Fix implicit _Complex to _Bool conversion in all contexts.

Currently:
- Condition contexts (if, while, for, ?:, &&, ||, !) test the stack pointer
  address of the complex value, which is always non-null, making conditions
  always true and ! always false.
- Implicit bool conversion (assignment, init, return, call args) only checks
  the real part, ignoring the imaginary part.

The fix:
- In lower_condition_expr: detect complex type and emit (real != 0) || (imag != 0)
- In assignment/init/return/call: when target is _Bool, check both real and imag
  parts, matching the explicit (_Bool) cast path that already works correctly.
