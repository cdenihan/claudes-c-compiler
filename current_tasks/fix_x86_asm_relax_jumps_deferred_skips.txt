Fix x86 assembler: relax_jumps not updating deferred_skips/deferred_byte_diffs offsets

When relax_jumps() shrinks sections by relaxing long jumps to short form,
it updates label positions, relocations, other jumps, and alignment markers,
but forgets to update deferred_skips and deferred_byte_diffs offsets.
This causes a panic (range end index out of bounds) when resolve_deferred_skips()
tries to splice bytes at the stale (pre-shrink) offset.

Fix: Add offset adjustment for deferred_skips and deferred_byte_diffs in the
relax_jumps() function alongside the existing offset updates.
