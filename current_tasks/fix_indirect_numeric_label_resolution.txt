Fix Operand::Indirect numeric label resolution in x86 assembler.

The resolve_numeric_operand() function in numeric_labels.rs did not handle
Operand::Indirect(inner), causing numeric label references like `0f` in
`jmp *0f(%rip)` to remain unresolved as a literal symbol "0f" instead
of being resolved to .Lnum_0_N.

This is a 4-line fix adding the Indirect case to recursively resolve
the inner operand.
