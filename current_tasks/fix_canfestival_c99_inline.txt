Fix canfestival build failure caused by C99 inline-only functions being completely
skipped during lowering.

C99 6.7.4p7: plain `inline` without `extern`/`static` is an "inline definition" that
does not provide an external definition. Currently, the lowerer skips these functions
entirely (line 717-721 in lower.rs), which means their bodies are never available for
the inliner. If the function is called, the caller emits an undefined reference that
the linker can't resolve.

Fix: Lower C99 inline-only functions as static functions (same as always_inline handling)
so their bodies are available for inlining. If all calls are inlined, the function is
dead and gets eliminated. If not, it's emitted as a local symbol.
