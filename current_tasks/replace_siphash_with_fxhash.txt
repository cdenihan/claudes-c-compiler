Task: Replace default SipHash with FxHash for all HashMap/HashSet

Profiling shows ~3.5% of compile time spent in SipHash (hash_one 1.77% + write 0.74% + insert probing 1.03%).
FxHash is 2-5x faster for small keys (u32, String, etc.) and is used by rustc itself.

Since this is a zero-dependency compiler, implement FxHasher inline (~20 lines)
and create FxHashMap/FxHashSet type aliases. Replace all 46+ HashMap/HashSet
instances across 15+ files.

Status: in progress
