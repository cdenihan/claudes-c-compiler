Fix libpng ARM build failure: __ARM_NEON defined but NEON intrinsics not supported

Problem: The compiler defines __ARM_NEON=1 when targeting AArch64, which causes
libpng's pngsimd.c to include arm/arm_init.c -> arm_neon.h, but CCC doesn't
support GCC's NEON intrinsic types (__Int8x8_t, uint8x16_t, etc.) or
__builtin_aarch64_* functions.

Fix: Remove __ARM_NEON define until NEON intrinsics are actually implemented.
This makes libpng compile the non-SIMD fallback path, which is correct behavior
since our compiler doesn't generate NEON code anyway.
