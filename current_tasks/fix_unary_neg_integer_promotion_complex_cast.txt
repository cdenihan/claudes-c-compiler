Fix missing integer promotion for unary Neg/Plus/BitNot in get_expr_ctype

Bug: When lowering expressions like `_Complex float cf = -uc;` where `uc` is
`unsigned char`, the compiler fails to apply integer promotion in
get_expr_ctype_lowerer(). The CType for `-uc` is returned as UChar instead
of Int. This causes the int-to-complex conversion path to emit a U8->F32
cast on an I32 value, truncating -10 (0xFFFFFFF6) to 246 (0xF6).

Fix: Apply integer_promote_ctype() for Neg, Plus, and BitNot unary ops
in get_expr_ctype_lowerer(). PreInc/PreDec should NOT be promoted since
they return the operand's own type.

Also fix the BitNot case in get_typeof_expr_ctype() at line ~1233.

Status: in_progress
