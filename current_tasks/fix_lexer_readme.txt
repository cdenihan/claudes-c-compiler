Fix lexer README: correct factual errors and improve accuracy

Issues to fix:
1. Says "six categories" of TokenKind variants but lists eight sections
2. Line marker description missing detail about spaces between # and digit
3. Missing mention of single-underscore GCC qualifier aliases (__const, __volatile, etc.)
4. Missing mention of C23 static_assert keyword spelling
5. Hex float imaginary suffix limitation not documented
6. Minor clarity improvements
