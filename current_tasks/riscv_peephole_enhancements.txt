Task: RISC-V Peephole Optimizer Enhancements
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Adding several peephole optimizations to the RISC-V backend that x86 and ARM
already have, to generate faster code:

1. Register copy propagation - propagate mov reg copies into subsequent
   instructions to eliminate redundant moves
2. Global store forwarding - track slot→register mappings across basic blocks
   to convert redundant loads into register moves
3. Branch-over-branch fusion - convert bCC .skip; j .target; .skip: into
   b!CC .target
4. Global dead store elimination - eliminate stores to stack slots that are
   never loaded (similar to ARM's implementation)
