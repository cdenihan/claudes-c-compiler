Deduplicating evaluation helpers and complex.rs type inference

Tasks:
1. Extract shared eval_cmp and eval_binop utility functions into ir/eval.rs
   - The same 10-arm IrCmpOp match appears 6+ times across cfg_simplify.rs, inline.rs, constant_fold.rs
   - The same binary op wrapping arithmetic appears multiple times
   - Create shared eval_cmp_i64, eval_cmp_u64, eval_cmp_f64, eval_binop_i64 functions
   - Replace all duplicate call sites with calls to the shared functions

2. Merge complex.rs expr_ctype with expr_types.rs get_expr_ctype
   - complex.rs has a ~190-line expr_ctype function that duplicates get_expr_ctype_lowerer
   - Make expr_ctype delegate to get_expr_ctype with CType::Int fallback

Status: in_progress
