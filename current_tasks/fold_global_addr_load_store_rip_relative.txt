Fold GlobalAddr + Load/Store into direct RIP-relative memory access

Enable the existing kernel-only optimization that folds GlobalAddr + Load/Store
into direct symbol(%rip) accesses for the default (small) code model on x86-64.

Previously, loading a global variable like `int x;` generated:
  leaq x(%rip), %rax     # compute address
  movq %rax, -0x20(%rbp) # spill to stack
  movq %rax, %rcx        # copy to temp
  movslq (%rcx), %rax    # load through pointer

Now generates:
  movslq x(%rip), %rax   # direct RIP-relative load

Also eliminates dead GlobalAddr instructions when all uses are folded.
Measured 4.2% text segment reduction on DOOM (67KB saved).
