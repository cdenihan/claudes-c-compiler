Task: Fix extern scope tracking, pp-number in #if, and push_macro/pop_macro

Three related correctness fixes:

1. Block-scope extern/function declaration scope tracking:
   When `extern int a;` or `int foo(void);` appears inside a block,
   self.locals.remove() was done without recording in ScopeFrame.
   On scope exit, the original local variable was not restored.
   Fix: Record removals in frame.locals_shadowed/statics_shadowed.

2. PP-number suffix expansion in #if condition evaluator:
   evaluate_condition() calls expand_condition_macros() which did not
   check for pp-number suffixes. So `#if 1u == 1` with `#define u 999`
   would expand `u` in `1u` to 999, giving `1999 == 1` (false).
   Fix: Add pp-number suffix check to expand_condition_macros().

3. #pragma push_macro("name") / pop_macro("name"):
   Not previously implemented. Added macro save stack to Preprocessor.

Status: In progress
