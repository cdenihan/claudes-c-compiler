ARM assembler: add missing instruction encodings

Adding the following missing instruction categories to the ARM (AArch64) assembler encoder:

1. Sub-word exclusive load/store: ldxrb, stxrb, ldaxrb, stlxrb, ldxrh, stxrh, ldaxrh, stlxrh
2. Sub-word load-acquire/store-release: ldarb, ldarh, stlrb, stlrh
3. System instructions: yield, clrex, dc civac
4. NEON vector instructions: cmeq, uqsub, sqsub, ushr, mul (vector), ext, addv, umov, dup,
   mov v.d[N]/xN (insert/extract), mov v.16b (register move), orr/and/eor with .16b arrangement
5. Parser support for NEON register arrangement operands (v0.16b etc.) and lane indexing (v0.d[1])

Also creating/updating scripts/compare_asm.py for testing.
