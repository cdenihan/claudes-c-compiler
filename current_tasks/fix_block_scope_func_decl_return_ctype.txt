Fix: block-scope function declarations set return_ctype to None

Bug: register_block_func_meta() in stmt_init.rs always sets return_ctype: None
for block-scope function declarations (e.g., `struct tag1 stfunc1();` inside main()).

This causes get_layout_for_expr() to fail to find the struct layout when
doing member access on the return value (e.g., `stfunc1().stia`), falling
back to offset 0 and type I32. The field access returns wrong values.

Fix: compute return_ctype in register_block_func_meta the same way
register_function_meta does - by resolving the CType from the type specifier
and wrapping with pointer layers as needed.

Status: IN PROGRESS
