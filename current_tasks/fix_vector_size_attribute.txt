Task: Implement __attribute__((vector_size(N))) support for GCC vector extensions
Status: in_progress

Problem: The vector_size attribute is parsed but silently ignored. Types declared with
__attribute__((vector_size(8))) like `typedef unsigned short v4hi __attribute__((vector_size(8)))`
are treated as plain scalars instead of vector types. Vector arithmetic (+=, +, -, *, /)
operates on only the first element, leaving other elements uninitialized.

This causes test failures in gcc_torture_20050604_1, gcc_torture_pr53645, and potentially
kernel miscompilations for code using GCC vector extensions.

Fix plan:
1. Add Vector variant to CType that stores (element_type, num_elements, total_size)
2. Parse vector_size attribute and create Vector CType
3. Lower vector operations to element-wise scalar operations in IR
4. Handle vector initialization, assignment, indexing
5. Ensure ABI compatibility (vectors passed/returned like same-sized integers or in memory)
