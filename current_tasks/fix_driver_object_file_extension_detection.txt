Fix: Driver should recognize non-standard object file extensions

The compiler driver's is_object_or_archive() only recognizes .o, .a, and .so extensions.
Projects like heatshrink use .os and .od extensions for object files.
When the compiler encounters these, it tries to read them as C source, which fails.

Fix: Instead of only checking extensions, also check for ELF magic bytes (\x7fELF)
when the extension isn't a recognized source extension (.c, .h, .i, .s, .S).
Also add common object file extensions: .os, .od, .lo, .obj.

This will fix the heatshrink project and potentially others.
