Fix implicit declaration warnings for __builtin_va_start/va_end/va_copy

These three builtins are handled correctly in IR lowering (expr.rs:924-956) but
are not registered in sema/builtins.rs BUILTIN_MAP. This causes spurious
"implicit declaration of function '__builtin_va_start'" warnings on stderr.

Impact: Configure scripts (zlib, others) that check stderr for errors will
incorrectly detect vsnprintf as unavailable, causing incorrect build flags
and test failures. zlib sets -DNO_vsnprintf -DHAS_vsprintf_void because of this.

Fix: Add __builtin_va_start, __builtin_va_end, __builtin_va_copy to the
builtin map in sema/builtins.rs so they are recognized as valid builtins.
