Task: Skip emission of __attribute__((always_inline)) static inline functions

Problem:
- Functions marked __attribute__((always_inline)) are designed to always be inlined
- Since we don't have a function inlining pass, we emit them as standalone functions
- This causes incorrect __jump_table entries in the kernel because inline asm "i" constraints
  can't be satisfied when the operand is a function parameter (not a compile-time constant)
- The broken __jump_table entries cause kernel boot failures (NULL key pointers)

Fix:
1. Parse __attribute__((always_inline)) and store is_always_inline in FunctionDef
2. Skip emitting always_inline functions as standalone functions (treat as unreferenced)
3. This prevents broken __jump_table entries and kernel boot failures
