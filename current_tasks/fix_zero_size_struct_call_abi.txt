Fix zero-size struct argument passing in function call ABI

Bug: When passing a zero-size struct (e.g., `struct { char x[0]; }`) as a function
argument, the compiler incorrectly allocates a GP register for it, consuming a register
slot that should belong to the next real argument. This causes subsequent arguments to
be read from the wrong positions.

This manifests as incorrect behavior in va_arg when a zero-size struct precedes real
arguments in a variadic call -- the va_list gets out of sync because the caller passed
the zero-size struct in a register, shifting all subsequent arguments.

Fix: In classify_call_args(), skip zero-size struct arguments entirely (don't assign
them any register or stack slot). Also ensure the caller-side lowering doesn't emit
any load/pass for zero-size struct arguments.

Affects test: gcc_torture_va_arg_22 (passes various sized structs 0..72 via va_arg).

Status: in_progress
