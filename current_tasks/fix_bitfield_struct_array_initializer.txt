Task: Fix bitfield struct array initializer bug
Started: 2026-01-30

Bug: When initializing a struct member that is an array of structs with bitfields,
using single-brace notation like `{8}` (instead of double-brace `{{8}}`), the scalar
value is not being correctly applied to the first bitfield member.

Example:
  struct inner { unsigned int a : 4; unsigned int b : 4; };
  struct outer { int x; struct inner arr[2]; };
  static struct outer o = {5, {8}};  // o.arr[0].a should be 8 but is 0

This affects the `lacc` project which uses this pattern extensively in its
x86 encoding table, causing wrong assembly output.
