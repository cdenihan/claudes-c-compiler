Task: Eliminate write-through stack stores for register-allocated values (x86)

The x86 backend uses a write-through strategy in store_rax_to(): when a value
has a callee-saved register assignment, it writes to BOTH the stack slot AND
the register. This produces a redundant memory write for every operation result
that has a register.

Changes:
1. In store_rax_to(), skip the stack store when the value has a register assignment
2. Update emit_load_ptr_from_slot to check register assignments (for GEP pointers)
3. Update emit_slot_addr_to_secondary to check register assignments
4. Update emit_memcpy_load_dest_addr/src_addr to check register assignments
5. Skip stack slot allocation for register-allocated values in calculate_stack_space

This eliminates ~50% of memory traffic for hot loops where values are
register-allocated, giving significant speedup on compute-heavy benchmarks.
