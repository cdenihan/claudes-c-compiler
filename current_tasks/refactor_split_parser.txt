Refactor parser.rs (3139 lines) into well-organized modules

parser.rs is the largest frontend file and contains all parsing logic in a
single monolithic file. Split it into logical modules:

1. parser.rs - Core Parser struct, constructor, entry point, basic helpers (~150 lines)
2. expressions.rs - All expression parsing (precedence climbing) (~720 lines)
3. types.rs - Type specifier parsing, struct fields, enum variants (~650 lines)
4. statements.rs - Statement and inline assembly parsing (~490 lines)
5. declarations.rs - External declarations and local declarations (~400 lines)
6. declarators.rs - Declarator parsing, parameter lists (~460 lines)

Also extract duplicated patterns:
- Abstract declarator suffix parsing (repeated 4 times)
- Storage class/qualifier post-loop (repeated in external and local decl)
- Typedef registration logic (repeated in external and local decl)
- Array dimension collection in struct fields (repeated twice)

Add README.md files for frontend/ and frontend/parser/ subdirectories.
