Fix __seg_gs store missing segment prefix

Bug: Stores through __seg_gs pointers (e.g., *(uint16_t __seg_gs *)addr = val)
were not getting the %gs: segment prefix in generated code, while loads were
correct. This caused kernel per-CPU variable writes to crash with NULL pointer
dereference (accessing raw per-CPU offset instead of GS-relative address).

Root cause: LValue::Address did not carry AddressSpace information, so
store_lvalue_typed() always used AddressSpace::Default. When lowering
*ptr = val where ptr has __seg_gs type qualifier, the address space was
lost in the lvalue representation.

Fix: Added AddressSpace field to LValue::Address variant. Now Expr::Deref
in lower_lvalue() detects the address space via get_addr_space_of_ptr_expr()
and propagates it through the LValue. store_lvalue_typed() and load_lvalue_typed()
use the LValue's address space for the seg_override on Store/Load instructions.

Also propagated address space for PointerMemberAccess (p->field through
__seg_gs pointer).

Kernel impact: Fixes boot failures in kernel/softirq.c and other files
that use per-CPU variable writes via __seg_gs named address spaces.
