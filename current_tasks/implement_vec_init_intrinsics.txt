Task: Implement __builtin_ia32_vec_init_v8hi/v4si/v16qi intrinsics

Problem: _mm_setr_epi16, _mm_setr_epi32, and _mm_set_epi16/32/8 (non-broadcast)
use vec_init builtins that are stubbed as Nop, returning 0 (NULL pointer).
The __CCC_M128I_FROM_BUILTIN macro then dereferences NULL, causing segfaults.

This breaks stb_image (IDCT SIMD path uses _mm_setr_epi16) and likely other
projects using SSE2 vector initialization.

Fix: Implement vec_init builtins properly in emmintrin.h using memory stores
to construct the vector from individual elements, or add proper intrinsic
support in the compiler backend.

Status: in_progress
