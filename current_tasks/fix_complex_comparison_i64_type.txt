Task: Fix complex comparison IR type from I64 to I32

Problem:
In lower_complex_comparison() in src/ir/lowering/complex.rs, the AND and comparison
operations that combine real/imaginary equality results use IrType::I64. However,
comparison results (from emit_cmp_val) are I32 values (0 or 1). On i686, I64 causes
64-bit register-pair operations (eax:edx), reading uninitialized upper 32 bits from
the stack, producing wrong results.

Fix:
Change IrType::I64 to IrType::I32 in the three places in lower_complex_comparison():
- Line 890: BinOp(And, real_eq, imag_eq)
- Line 894: BinOp(And, real_eq, imag_eq) for Ne case
- Line 895: Cmp(Eq, both_eq, 0) for Ne case

This affects ~15-20 test failures in the i686 suite (complex-comparison, complex-assignment tags).
