Fix cJSON build with i686 builtin linker.

The i686 builtin linker is missing TLS relocation support (R_386_TLS_GOTIE type 16,
and potentially other TLS relocations). This causes the link to fail when linking
with libm.a which uses TLS for errno.

Plan:
- Add TLS section layout to i686 linker (PT_TLS segment)
- Add R_386_TLS_GOTIE relocation handling (GOT entry with negative TLS offset)
- Add any other TLS relocations needed (R_386_TLS_LE, R_386_TLS_IE, etc.)
