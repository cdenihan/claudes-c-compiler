Fix RISC-V standalone defconfig kernel: spinlock bad magic BUG

The standalone RISC-V defconfig kernel builds successfully but crashes during
boot with "BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0" in the securityfs init path.
The spinlock's magic field is 0 instead of the expected value, suggesting
a codegen bug affecting struct initialization or constant propagation.

Will delta-debug by comparing GCC-compiled and CCC-compiled object files
to identify which source file's codegen is broken.
