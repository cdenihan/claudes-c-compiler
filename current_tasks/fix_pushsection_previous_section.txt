Fix .pushsection/.popsection to save/restore previous_section

When .pushsection is used, it calls process_section_directive which
clobbers previous_section. After .popsection restores current_section,
a subsequent .previous would go to the wrong section because
previous_section was not saved/restored.

This is an assembler conformance issue: GNU as saves and restores
both current_section and previous_section in push/pop.

Fix: save previous_section alongside current_section in push_section,
and restore it in pop_section.
