Task: Fix bitfield integer promotion (C11 6.3.1.1p2)

Bug: An unsigned bitfield narrower than int should promote to int (signed),
not unsigned int, because int can represent all values of the bitfield.
Currently the compiler promotes unsigned bitfields to unsigned int, which
changes the semantics of arithmetic operations (e.g., signed % unsigned
gives unsigned result instead of signed).

Test case: tests/bitfield-integer-promotion/main.c

Fix location: Frontend type checker / semantic analysis where bitfield
promotion is computed. The usual arithmetic conversion needs to consider
the bitfield width, not just the declared type's signedness.
