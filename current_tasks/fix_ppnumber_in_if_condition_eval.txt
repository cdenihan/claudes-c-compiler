Task: Fix pp-number suffix not skipped in #if condition macro expansion
Status: In progress

The expand_condition_macros() function in conditionals.rs does not skip pp-number
tokens when expanding macros. When a macro like `#define u 1` is defined and
an expression like `#if 1u == 1` is evaluated, the `u` suffix in `1u` is
incorrectly treated as a macro identifier and expanded to `1`, resulting in
`11 == 1` (false) instead of `1u == 1` (true).

The fix is to add pp-number skipping logic (similar to what expand_text in
macro_defs.rs already has) to expand_condition_macros, so that digit-starting
tokens consume their alphanumeric suffixes without attempting macro expansion.

This affects at least compiler_suite_0125_0029 and potentially other tests.
