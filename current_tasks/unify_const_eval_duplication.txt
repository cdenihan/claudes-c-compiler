Task: Unify duplicated const_eval code between sema and lowering
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
sema/const_eval.rs (1278 lines) and ir/lowering/const_eval.rs (1667 lines) contain
~450 lines of near-identical code for:
- Literal evaluation (IntLiteral, LongLiteral, etc.)
- Builtin function folding (__builtin_bswap, __builtin_clz, etc.)
- eval_const_expr_as_bits
- eval_const_binop wrapper
- promote_sub_int_for_unary / promote_const_for_unary
- Cast chain evaluation
- Offsetof patterns

Plan:
1. Extract shared pure-evaluation logic into common/const_eval.rs
2. Move all literal eval, builtin folding, unary promotion, and
   eval_as_bits into the shared module using a trait for type resolution
3. Have both sema and lowering delegate to the shared implementation
4. Each retains only its unique logic (sema: type inference, lowering: global addresses)
