Task: Reduce stack frame bloat by lowering Tier 2 packing threshold and enabling single-block coalescing
Status: in_progress

The compiler generates larger stack frames than GCC because:
1. Tier 2 liveness-based packing is only enabled for functions with >= 8 blocks AND >= 64 instructions
2. Single-block functions get no coalescing at all (coalesce requires >= 2 blocks)

This causes postgres plpgsql recursion tests to fail with "stack depth exceeded".

Fix:
- Lower or remove the Tier 2 threshold so medium-sized functions get liveness-based packing
- Enable coalescing for single-block functions
- Verify postgres plpgsql tests pass after the fix
