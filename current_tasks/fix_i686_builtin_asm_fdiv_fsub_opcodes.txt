Fix i686 builtin assembler: fdivp/fdivrp and fsubp/fsubrp opcodes are swapped.

In AT&T syntax (which our assembler uses):
- fdivrp should encode as DE F9 (not DE F1)
- fdivp should encode as DE F1 (not DE F9)
- fsubrp should encode as DE E9 (not DE E1)
- fsubp should encode as DE E1 (not DE E9)

The opcodes were swapped, causing reversed division/subtraction results
when using the builtin assembler (MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin).
This fix only touches the i686 backend.
