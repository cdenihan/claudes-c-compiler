Fix -Wreturn-type false positive for switch statements with default case

The -Wreturn-type warning (added in 93e42c7d) treats all switch statements
as able to fall through, causing false positives when every case (including
default) contains a return. This breaks the kernel build with -Werror.

Fix: Add switch exhaustiveness analysis to stmt_can_fall_through() that
checks if the switch has a default case and all case branches diverge
(return/goto/break).

Status: in_progress
