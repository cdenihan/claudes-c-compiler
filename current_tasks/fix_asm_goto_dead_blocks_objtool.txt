Fix asm goto dead block removal causing objtool "unreachable instruction" errors

Problem: When the backend skips an asm goto template (because of unsatisfiable immediate
constraints + .pushsection), the goto label target blocks become unreachable dead code.
But the CFG dead block elimination pass treats asm goto labels as reachable successors
(regardless of whether the asm will actually be emitted), so these blocks survive to
codegen. objtool then detects them as unreachable instructions and errors out, causing
kernel relink failures for files like drivers/md/dm.c.

Fix: In the CFG simplify pass's dead block removal, check whether an asm goto instruction
will be skipped at codegen time (has unsatisfiable immediate-only constraints AND template
uses .pushsection). If so, don't mark the goto label blocks as reachable, allowing the
dead block elimination to remove them.

Files changed:
- src/passes/cfg_simplify.rs: Added asm_goto_will_be_skipped() helper and
  is_immediate_only_constraint() helper; modified remove_dead_blocks() to use them.
