Fix: goto jumping past variable declarations produces garbage values

Bug: When goto jumps past a local variable declaration, the variable's alloca
is emitted in unreachable dead code (the block after the goto). At runtime,
the alloca never executes, so the variable has no valid stack slot. Any
subsequent use of that variable reads/writes garbage memory.

Example:
  goto skip;
  int x = 42;   // alloca lands in dead block after goto
skip:
  x = 5;        // uses the alloca Value, but it was never allocated at runtime
  printf("%d\n", x);  // prints garbage

Fix: Hoist local variable allocas to the entry block by collecting them in a
deferred buffer (entry_allocas) during lowering, then splicing them into
blocks[0] after the parameter allocas during finalize_function.

Files changed:
  - src/ir/lowering/func_state.rs: Added entry_allocas field
  - src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs: Added emit_entry_alloca() method, merge in finalize_function
  - src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs: Changed lower_local_decl to use emit_entry_alloca for static-size locals

Tests fixed:
  - wacc_chapter_6_valid_extra_credit_goto_after_declaration (all archs)
  - tcc_54_goto (all archs)
