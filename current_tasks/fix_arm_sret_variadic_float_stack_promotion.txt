Fix ARM64 sret+variadic: float stack args incorrectly promoted to GP register

When a variadic function returns a struct via sret on AArch64, the sret pointer
goes in x8 (not x0), freeing one GP register slot. The emit_call code in traits.rs
promotes the first Stack-classified arg to the freed GP register (x7). But this is
wrong when the first Stack arg is a float/double that overflowed from FP registers.

The bug causes the 9th floating-point argument to be passed in x0 (GP register)
instead of on the stack, shifting all subsequent stack args by 8 bytes.

Fix: check arg_types before promoting a Stack arg to IntReg in the sret fixup.
Only promote non-float Stack args.
