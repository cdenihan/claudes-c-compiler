Add missing ARM64 system registers needed for kernel defconfig build.

The ARM64 kernel defconfig build fails because the assembler is missing:
1. Debug breakpoint control/value registers: dbgbcr0_el1..dbgbcr15_el1,
   dbgbvr0_el1..dbgbvr15_el1, dbgwcr0_el1..dbgwcr15_el1,
   dbgwvr0_el1..dbgwvr15_el1
2. MSR SPSel immediate form: `msr spsel, #<imm>` (PSTATE field)
3. par_el1 in MSR table (currently only in MRS)
4. Any other missing registers identified during testing
