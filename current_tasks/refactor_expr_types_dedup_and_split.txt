Refactor expr_types.rs: Deduplicate _Generic resolution, __builtin_choose_expr, and split sizeof

Status: in_progress

Task:
- Unify resolve_generic_selection_ctype and resolve_generic_selection_type into a single
  function that returns the matched expression reference, eliminating ~48 lines of duplication
- Deduplicate __builtin_choose_expr handling (identical in get_expr_type and get_expr_ctype_lowerer)
- Extract sizeof-related functions (~477 lines) into a new expr_sizeof.rs file

Files affected:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_types.rs (primary)
- src/ir/lowering/expr_sizeof.rs (new, split from expr_types.rs)
- src/ir/lowering/mod.rs (add new module)
