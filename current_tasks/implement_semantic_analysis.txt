Implement real semantic analysis with scoped symbol table

The sema module is currently a no-op pass-through. The project requires
"type-check, build scoped symbol table, diagnose errors".

Plan:
1. Integrate SymbolTable into SemanticAnalyzer
2. Walk the AST to declare and look up symbols (variables, functions, typedefs)
3. Track function signatures for call-site validation
4. Map __builtin_* function names to their libc equivalents in lowering
5. Add type tracking (at minimum: int, char, pointer, function types)
6. Emit diagnostics for undeclared identifiers using error.rs
