Include Guard Detection for Preprocessor Speed
================================================
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Task:
  Implement include guard detection in the preprocessor so that headers
  with traditional #ifndef/#define/#endif guards are not re-read and
  re-processed on subsequent #include directives.

Approach:
  1. Track directive patterns during preprocessing of included files
  2. After preprocessing, detect if the file follows the guard pattern:
     - First directive is #ifndef MACRO
     - Second directive is #define MACRO (same macro name)
     - Last directive is #endif matching the outermost #ifndef
     - No other code outside the guard
  3. Store guard macro name mapped to file path
  4. On subsequent #include, check if guard macro is still defined;
     if so, skip re-processing entirely
