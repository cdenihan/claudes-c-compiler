Task: Fix __thread const globals emitted to both .rodata and .tdata
Status: in_progress

Bug: When a global variable is both `const` and `__thread` (e.g., `static __thread const int c = 3`),
the compiler emits the symbol twice:
1. Once in .rodata (because it's const)
2. Once in .tdata (because it's __thread)

This causes the assembler to error: "symbol `c` is already defined".

Fix: In the .rodata emission pass in src/backend/common.rs, skip `is_thread_local` globals.
TLS takes precedence over const — the variable should only appear in .tdata.
