Fix (*f)() double-dereference of function pointer in call expressions

The compiler incorrectly generates a double dereference when calling through
an explicitly dereferenced function pointer: (*f)(args...).

In C, dereferencing a function pointer yields a function designator which
immediately decays back to a function pointer, so (*f)(...) and f(...) should
produce identical code. Currently the compiler treats the * as a real memory
load, producing a NULL dereference when the function pointer value is treated
as an address to load from.

This is the root cause of the Lua segfault regression - lua_newstate calls
(*f)(ud, NULL, LUA_TTHREAD, sizeof(LG)) where f is a lua_Alloc function pointer.

Fix: In the call expression lowering, when the callee is a dereference of a
function pointer, skip the dereference and use the pointer directly.
