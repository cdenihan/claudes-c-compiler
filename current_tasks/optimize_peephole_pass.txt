Task: Optimize the peephole optimizer pass for dramatically faster compilation

Profiling shows the x86 peephole optimizer consumes ~21% of compile time:
- str::trim_matches: 11.39% (trimming every line on every pass iteration)
- peephole_optimize: 9.40% (the pass itself)
- memcmp: 6.62% (string comparisons in pattern matching)
- parse_store_to_rbp/parse_load_from_rbp: 3.3% combined

Root cause: the peephole operates on String lines, calling .trim() on every
line for every pass (up to 10 iterations). For sqlite3.c with ~500K lines of
assembly, this means 5M+ trim_matches calls.

Fix: Pre-trim lines once on entry and store trimmed slices; avoid redundant
trimming in inner loops. Also avoid allocating <<NOP>> Strings (use a bool
vector to track eliminated lines instead).

Status: in progress
